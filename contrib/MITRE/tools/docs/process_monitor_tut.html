<p>The process monitor is a tool which allows the user to control and monitor
 system processes in a variety of configurations. This tools is used extensively
 in the tutorial and in the examples in the Galaxy Communicator distribution.
 In this lesson, we learn about the various parts of the process monitor
and  how to use them. </p>

<h2> <a name="Starting_the_process_monitor"></a>Starting the process monitor</h2>
   There are a couple different ways to start the process monitor, but we'll
 be starting it with a file which describes the configuration of processes
 that it will run. The process monitor executable can be found at <tt>$GC_HOME/contrib/MITRE/tools/bin/process_monitor</tt>. 
 Let's start it up to run a couple of simple Unix applications.   
<blockquote><b><tt>[Process monitor exercise 1]<br>
  <br>
Unix:<br>
  </tt></b>       
  <p><tt>% process_monitor $GC_HOME/tutorial/process_monitor/dir.config 1
 &amp;<br>
  </tt></p>
  <p><tt><b>Windows:</b><br>
  </tt></p>
  <p><tt>C:\&gt; python %PM_DIR%\process_monitor.py %GC_HOME%\tutorial\process_monitor\dir.config
3<br>
  </tt></p>
  </blockquote>
   (If the shell can't find the process monitor application, make sure you've
 <a href="../../../../docs/manual/tutorial/getting_started.html">configured 
 your environment correctly</a>.) You'll get a window which looks like this
(on Unix; it will look a little different on Windows)::

<p> </p>
   
<hr width="100%">   
<h2> <a name="The_menu_bar"></a>The menu bar</h2>
   The process monitor contains a menu bar, which controls the overall configuration
 of the process monitor and the collection of processes.   
<h3> The File menu</h3>
   The File menu contains the Quit command, which shuts down all the processes
 and exits the process monitor.   
<h3> The Process Control menu</h3>
   The Process Control menu contains three commands:   
<ul>
   <li> Stop all, which stops all the processes</li>
    <li> Clear all, which resets all the scrollable output histories</li>
    <li> Restart all, which stops all the processes which are running and 
then starts all the processes</li>
     
</ul>
      
<h3> The Configuration menu</h3>
   The Configuration menu allows you to choose between two different configurations: 
  
<ul>
   <li> Column configuration, which displays all the processes in one, two
 or three columns</li>
    <li> Compressed configuration, which displays only a single process at
 a time, which you can switch between with a set of radio buttons; you can
 select one, two or three rows of buttons</li>
     
</ul>
 
<h3>The Process Set menu</h3>
 If the configuration file you're using has more than one set of processes 
it can run, the Process Set menu will switch between different sets of processes. 
When you switch between process sets, the current process set (if there is 
one) will be shut down.<br>
 <br>
      
<hr width="100%">   
<h2> <a name="The_process_panes"></a>The process panes</h2>
   The process monitor presents each process as four panes:   
<ul>
   <li> A command bar, which includes the Hide/Show button as well as the 
title of the process</li>
    <li> A scrollable output history, which contains the command to be executed,
 in square brackets, and the output of the command (both standard output
and  standard error)</li>
    <li> An editable command line</li>
    <li> A control bar, which contains the Start/Stop button, the Keep alive/Let
 die button, the Clear button and the Pause output/Resume output button</li>
     
</ul>
   Whether or not all these panes are visible depends on the Hide/Show button.
 In the example here, there are two processes, one which has all four panes
 visible, and one which has only the command bar.   
<h3> Hide/Show</h3>
   Press the button marked "Hide" on the command bar titled "Current directory".
 See how the lower three panes for the process vanish. Like the command bar
 titled "Directory contents", the run status now appears on the command bar
 on the far right, and this button now reads "Show". Press it again to restore
 the configuration.   
<h3> Start/Stop</h3>
   Press the button marked "Start". The process monitor will now run a command
which prints the current working directory, and you'll see something like
the following output in the scrollable output  history:   
<blockquote><b><tt>[Scrollable output pane]<br>
  <br>
Unix:<br>
  </tt></b>       
  <p><tt>[exec pwd 2&gt;&amp;1]</tt> <br>
    <tt>/usr/GalaxyCommunicator-3.2</tt> <br>
    <tt>======================================<br>
  </tt></p>
  <p><b><tt>Windows:</tt></b></p>
  <p><tt>[cmd.exe /c chdir]<br>
C:\<br>
======================================<br>
  </tt></p>
  </blockquote>
   Note the row of equals signs ("="). This indicates that the process has
 halted. You may also have noticed that for the instant the process is running,
 this button reads "Stop". While the button reads "Stop", you can press it
 to stop the process.   
<h3> Keep alive/Let die</h3>
   Press the button marked "Keep alive". The process will now be automatically
 restarted if it dies of its own accord. The button now reads "Let die".
Press  "Start" and notice how the command is called over and over. Press
"Stop"  to halt this sequence, and "Let die" to disable automatic restart.
  
<h3> Clear</h3>
   Press the button marked "Clear". The scrollable output history is cleared
 and the command to be executed is rewritten to the output pane.   
<h3> Pause output/Resume output</h3>
   This final toggle button pauses and resumes the output. Press "Keep alive"
 again, and then "Start". As the process is running over and over, press
"Pause  output", and note that nothing is now being added to the scrollable
output  pane. The button now reads "Resume output". Press "Resume output",
then "Stop",  then "Let die".   
<p> </p>
   
<hr width="100%">   
<h2> <a name="Using_the_menu_bar"></a>Using the menu bar</h2>
   Press "Show" on the command bar titled "Directory contents". Select "Process
 Control -&gt; Restart all". Both processes run and terminate. Select "Process
 Control -&gt; Clear all" to clear all the scrollable output panes.   
<p>Next, we'll switch configurations. Select "Configuration -&gt; Compressed
 configuration -&gt; One button row". Now the process monitor displays a
single  output history, command line and control bar, with a row of buttons
directly  below the menu bar to select the displayed process. Try switching
between  the two processes, and start, stop and clear the processes to convince
yourself  that the process displayed in the pane corresponds to the selected
process  in the button row. </p>
   
<p>The "Detach this pane" button at the bottom allows you to view a given
 process in its own window with its own set of panes. Press this button.
The  button corresponding to the current process disappears from the button
row,  and the new window which appears has a no menu bar and a button at
the bottom  which says "Reattach this pane". When the separate window is
reattached, the corresponding button is re-added to the button row on the
main window.<br>
 <br>
 Finally, let's switch process sets. Select "Process Set -&gt; Environment 
settings". Now the process monitor displays a single process, different from 
the others. Start this process. Now use the "Process Set" menu to switch between
the two process sets. Notice that each process set is in the state you left
it in.<br>
   </p>
   
<p>Once you're done exploring the process monitor, select "File -&gt; Quit"
 to exit. </p>
