<p>Both these tools manage the behavior of the Hub and multiple servers (although
  they can be used to manage any arbitrary executable). The <tt>process_monitor</tt> 
  is a Python GUI which provides a pane for each managed executable; the panes
 can be hidden and redisplayed, and each process can be stopped and restarted.
 The <tt>csh_process_monitor </tt>is a version which provides a separate
xterm  for each process (so it does not provide some of the process management
support).  If <tt>&lt;GC_HOME&gt;/templates/config.make</tt> has not enabled
Python at compilation time, <tt>process_monitor</tt> will be identical to
<tt>csh_process_monitor</tt>.  </p>
       
<p>There are two different ways of configuring the Python GUI: through command
  line flags or through a configuration file. You may use one or the other,
  but not both. For the csh tool, only the command line flag option is available. 
  </p>

<hr width="100%" size="2"> 
<h2>What processes can be controlled?<br>
 </h2>
 
<p>The process monitor spawns a subprocess for each executable, and controls 
the process through the process ID of the process it spawns. What this means 
is that when the process monitor kills a subprocess, it can only kill the 
subprocess it spawned, not any of that process's children. This imposes some 
limitations and requirements on these subprocesses on the various platforms.<br>
 </p>
 
<h3>Unix</h3>
 Each subprocess is passed as a command line to <tt>/bin/sh</tt>. This has 
an advantage and a disadvantage. The advantage is that you can invoke any 
command, including shell built-ins like <tt>printenv</tt>. The disadvantage 
is that any real executable is now a child of the spawned process. This is 
why, when you see the invoked subprocess in the process monitor display pane, 
the subprocess is prefixed with <tt>exec</tt>. This shell built-in substitutes 
the new process for the old in the current process space, so in effect, <tt>/bin/sh</tt> 
turns into the process you wanted to call.<br>
 
<p>This set of requirements imposes some restrictions on the command lines 
you can invoke. You can use shell redirection of I/O, but you shouldn't use 
pipes (separated by "|") or sequences (separated by ":"), even though you 
have a shell. The reason is that both of these constructs implicitly spawn 
a shell for each component, and even if you <tt>exec</tt> the entire line, 
you'll still end up killing the parent of what you really want to kill. Similarly, 
if your executable is a shell script, you must ensure that the shell script 
<tt>exec</tt>s the executable it ultimately calls, or you'll once again end 
up killing the parent of what you really want to kill. (Note that this also 
imposes some restrictions on what sorts of shell scripts you can control.) 
So the following script is kosher:<br>
 </p>
 
<blockquote><tt>#!/bin/sh<br>
   <br>
 exec /usr/bin/my_executable</tt><br>
 </blockquote>
 
<p>but the following script is not:<br>
 </p>
 
<blockquote><tt>#!/bin/sh<br>
   <br>
 /usr/bin/my_executable</tt><br>
 </blockquote>
 
<h3>Windows</h3>
 On Windows, the command line you provide is the command line that gets invoked, 
because there's no such thing as <tt>exec</tt> among the MS-DOS batch commands. 
This means that the restrictions are a little different. First, if you want 
any MS-DOS built-ins, you have to prefix them with <tt>cmd.exe /c</tt>. Second, 
you shouldn't execute batch files at all as subprocesses, because the executables 
they invoke are guaranteed to be orphaned with the process monitor kills the
batch shell that invoked them.<br>

<h2> Command line flags</h2>
     The relevant arguments for the two monitors differ slightly, but both
 processes  will accept the entire set of arguments (and ignore the ones
that  aren't relevant). The command line arguments are "chunked"; there is
a set  of arguments for each process, for which the command line argument
-c terminates  each "chunk". <br>

     </tr>

</table>
          
<p>In addition to these arguments there are five other, global arguments: 
  </p>
       
<ul>
     <li> <tt>--ncols &lt;int&gt;</tt> (Python): how many columns should
the   process panes be arranged in? This argument can appear anywhere in
the command   line. Default is 1.</li>
      <li> <tt>--compressed</tt> (Python): if specified, start up in a compressed
  configuration, with a single process viewer and buttons to switch the viewer
  between processes. When <tt>--compressed</tt> is specified, <tt>--ncols</tt>
  becomes the number of button rows. This argument can appear anywhere in
the  command line.</li>
      <li> <tt>--clear_history &lt;int&gt;</tt> (Python): if specified, clears
  the history of each pane after the specified number of lines are written.
  This means that long-running processes won't grind to a halt because of
Tcl  update delays.</li>
      <li> <tt>--master_title &lt;title&gt;</tt> (Python): if specified,
sets   the title of the main window (default is "Process monitor").</li>
      <li> <tt>--sleep &lt;int&gt;</tt> (csh): how many seconds should the
 xterm  sleep before starting the process? This argument can be interspersed
 anywhere  in the command line, and applies to the current "chunk" and all
 subsequent  chunks; this argument can be repeated. Initial default is 0.</li>
         
</ul>
     In the Python version, the command line is echoed both in the history
 window  and in a typein window. You can modify the command line in the typein
 window  and the changes will be recognized on restart. Also, the "keepalive"
 behavior  and the window configuration can be reconfigured after startup
via the process  monitor GUI.

<h2> <a name="Command_line_flag_example"></a>Command line flag example</h2>
     This example shows how you might use the process monitor in a C shell
 to  start up a configuration of servers to interact with a database. Each
 of the command lines is a single line, in spite of the wrapping imposed
by  your browser.     
<blockquote><tt>% setenv MITRE_ROOT $GC_HOME/contrib/MITRE</tt> <br>
      <tt>% setenv DEMO_ROOT $MITRE_ROOT/examples/sql_explore</tt> <br>
      <tt>% $MITRE_ROOT/tools/bin/process_monitor --master_title "DB Interaction" 
  \</tt> <br>
      <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -T "DB" --open -c "$MITRE_ROOT/tools/bin/run_server 
  $GC_HOME/contrib/MITRE/servers/bin/db_server -dblogin galaxy/galaxy" \</tt> 
    <br>
      <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -T "SQL Monitor" --open --input_line -c "$MITRE_ROOT/servers/bin/c_ui 
  -prompt 'Type a query: ' -verbosity 0" \</tt> <br>
      <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -T "Hub" --open -c "$GC_HOME/bin/hub -pgm_file 
 $DEMO_ROOT/bare_query.pgm"</tt></blockquote>
     This invocation of the process monitor creates three panes, all of which
  are open at startup, all of which must be started by the user by hand.
    
<ul>
     <li> The first is a database server, which is started by the <tt>run_server</tt>
  script.</li>
      <li> The second is a typein server which has a space to type in a line.</li>
      <li> The third is the Galaxy Communicator Hub executable.</li>
         
</ul>
          
<hr width="100%">     
<h2><a name="Configuration_file"></a> Configuration file</h2>
     All the information which can be specified on the command line can be
 specified  in the configuration file, and more. A configuration file consists
 of a number  of process blocks, as well as global information. Each of the
 process blocks  may contain multiple processes, and each process block corresponds
 to a possible  invocation of the process monitor. If there are multiple
process  blocks, and the name or index of the desired block has not been
specified  on the command line, the process monitor will list the available
blocks and  exit.     
<p>All arguments after a double dash ("--") on the command line are passed
  to the configuration file, to be substituted into the command lines in
the   same way that the <tt>EXPAND:</tt> directive does. These arguments
are made   available as $1, $2, etc., or as the name listed in the corresponding
position   in the <tt>ARGUMENTS:</tt> directive. </p>
       
<p>All entries in the configuration file are a single line long. Lines starting
  with a pound sign ("#") are ignored, as are lines consisting entirely of
 whitespace. The first token in the line is the directive, and the remaining
 data is the value. By convention, all the directives end with a colon (":").
