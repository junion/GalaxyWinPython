;; This file is designed intentionally to break. It 
;; should be run with the -validate argument for the Hub.
;; Among the errors that should be caught are:

;; (1) unrecognized keyword :foo for complex_twice
;; (2) not return value from complex twice when there should be
;; (3) missing :int input keyword for multiply

;; because multiply has no input, it will raise an 
;; error, which will be reported back to the double server,
;; and execution will halt. Execution would have halted
;; anyway because complex_twice does not return a frame.
