;; Note that this rule requires a response.
;; If you change this to complex_twice, you'll
;; get a deadlock, because it's invoking the multiply
;; program via a server-to-server subdialogue, and
;; the Hub can't contact the server to process echo_frame
;; when the server is already processing the complex_twice
;; message. The continuation_complex_twice message
;; sets up a continuation and tells the hub that it's free.
