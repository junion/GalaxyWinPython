;; This program file exemplifies a number of the features of
;; logging. It also exemplifies partial scripting (there's a main
;; program to handle complex_twice, but multiply is routed
;; directly to its server).

;; (1) The invocation of the "main" program will be timestamped.
;; (2) In keys for the rule firing complex_twice will be logged.
;; (3) In and out keys for the multiply message will be logged 
;; (when the new message arrives and its response leaves).
;; (4) The multiply message will be timestamped because its
;; keys are logged.
;; (5) The final error returned by multiply will be logged.
;; (6) The log version will be passed through to the log file.

;; See the directory sls/ for your logs.
