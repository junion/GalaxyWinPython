;; -------------------------------------------------

;; We create a session here so that it will be passed
;; to env_testaudio_receive. This server will store the
;; session ID and return it automatically when it
;; sends the notification message, by virtue of using
;; the environment. If you use the testaudio_receive
;; server, you'll see that it doesn't forward the session
;; ID, because it uses the bare connection.

;; We test for both here, so we can use this program
;; file in all modes.
