domain_functions.c and server_functions.c
 are used at compile time to create appropriate
 headers for the instantiations of particular servers.

The former only applies for the domain servers,
  which run off of ".dctl" files in the System directory.

server_functions.c creates a file .../src/{server}/server.h
 that specifies the operations handled by the particular
 server in the hub program.

Makefile.head, domain_functions.make and server_functions.make 
  are used to compile these two programs into the ../../bin/ directory.

To make any particular server, go to its directory and type:

   gmake [debug]
