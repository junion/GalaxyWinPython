How to add functions to the compat/ directory
---------------------------------------------

The compatibility functions here are intended to provide functionality
which may be used by SLS or GalaxyCommunicator which is missing from
the OS (e.g., usleep() in Solaris). Since it's necessary to be able to
link both against the core GalaxyCommunicator library and the SLS
utilities library, we have to set up these compatibility functions so
that the symbols don't clash. We've chosen to do this by putting a
single function in each file and relying on the properties of the C
linker, which will not load a file in an archive if no functions from
it are needed. 

If you need to add a compatibility function, create a file for it and
add the file to the appropriate Makefile (either
src/libGalaxy/Makefile for the GalaxyCommunicator core, or
sls/src/lib/util/Makefile for SLS utilities). Make sure you
conditionalize the inclusion of the file using the appropriate $(ARCH)
and $(OS) Makefile variables. 

Setting things up this way allows the two archives to get out of synch
without causing linking problems; however, in principle, the compat/
subdirectories in the two systems ought to remain identical.
