<h2> <a name="Selecting_your_servers"></a>Selecting your servers</h2>
    The toy travel demo illustrated a representative set of servers you might 
 need in your end-to-end system:    
<ul>
    <li> An audio server which supports some sort of telephony hardware,
such  as ComputerFone or Dialogic;</li>
     <li> A recognition server which maps audio samples into text strings;</li>
     <li> A parsing server which maps text strings into semantic frames;</li>
     <li> A dialogue manager server which incorporates each incoming semantic 
 frame into the current context and decides how to act on the resulting context;</li>
     <li> An information server, such as a relational database;</li>
     <li> A language generation server which maps outgoing frames into text 
 strings;</li>
     <li> A speech synthesis server which maps text strings into audio samples.</li>
       
</ul>
    There are a wide range of variations on this configuration. For instance:
    
<ul>
    <li> In some cases, you may choose to "federate" audio, recognition and 
 synthesis in the same server. You might do this, for instance, because your 
 recognizer can only read input from the audio device (this is the case with 
 JSAPI-compliant recognizers in Java 1.2, due to limitations of Javasound 
in that version of Java).</li>
     <li> You may have a separate server for mapping dialogue representations 
 into representations the information server can understand (an SQL generation 
 server, for instance).</li>
     <li> You may have a different information server, such as a script which 
 harvests information from Web pages, or you may have multiple information 
 servers, either for cacheing, redundancy, or to cover multiple domains.</li>
     <li> Your recognizer may return more structured output, such as n-best 
 lists or word lattices, or provide confidence measures along with its recognition 
 results.</li>
     <li> You may choose to separate the dialogue server's function of incorporation 
 into context from its function of choosing what to do with the resulting 
context.</li>
     <li> You may choose to provide a user profile server, either for security 
 or user modeling or both, which might register a user by voice or by touchtone 
 input.</li>
     <li> You may choose to have multiple UI elements, such as a Web browser 
 and a telephone connection working in tandem.</li>
       
</ul>
    The Galaxy Communicator architecture places no restrictions on any of 
these  configurations (although in its current form, it may accidently or 
intentionally  make some configurations easier than others).    
<p>We have released an initial version of an open source toolkit which contains 
 a number of available Communicator-compliant wrappers which are free and 
available to use. In addition, a number of Communicator developers are also 
distributing such software. </p>
     
<p> </p>
     
<hr width="100%">    
<h2> <a name="Contacting_the_Hub"></a>Contacting the Hub</h2>
    One thing we haven't talked about in detail is how to set up servers
which  contact the Hub. It's actually trivial. There's a command line argument 
<tt>-contact_hub</tt>  which is available by default to all Communicator-compliant 
servers which  allows you to specify <tt>host:port</tt> where a Hub has set 
up the appropriate  listener. You can find detailed documentation about this 
in the <a href="../advanced/hub_listener.html">Hub listener documentation</a>. 
The  short version is that there are two steps.    
<p>First, you should use the CLIENT_PORT: program file directive to set up 
 the Hub listener, as we saw in our <a
 href="pgm_intro.html#CLIENT_PORT:">program  file tutorial</a>. Second, you 
should start up the server using <tt>-contact_hub</tt>.  As an example, here's 
the command line to start up the Audio server from the toy travel demo: </p>
     
<blockquote><tt>% $DEMO_ROOT/bin/Audio -audio_data $GC_HOME/tutorial/toy-travel/short-example.frames
  -contact_hub localhost:2800 -verbosity 0</tt></blockquote>
    The Hub program file has the appropriate listener set up:    
<blockquote><tt>SERVICE_TYPE: Audio</tt> <br>
     <tt>CLIENT_PORT: 2800</tt> <br>
     <tt>OPERATIONS: Play</tt></blockquote>
    Under normal operating circumstances, you should be able to connect as
 many servers as you want to the Hub listener; there is no limit imposed.
If you want the listener locked to a particular session, you can use the
<tt>-session_id</tt>  command line argument we talked about in the <a
 href="session_tutorial.html#Creating_sessions">session lesson</a>.    
<p> </p>
     
<hr width="100%">    
<h2> <a name="Guidelines_for_writing_servers_and_Hub_programs"></a>Guidelines
  for writing servers and Hub programs</h2>
        
<h3> Always use the environment to write messages to the Hub</h3>
    There are publicly available functions in the Galaxy Communicator API 
which  allow you to write messages to the Hub using the connection directly, 
instead  of the environment. But if you use call environments, you're always 
guaranteed  of passing along the correct session information. We recommend 
<b>always</b>  using the call environment.    
<h3> Make sure to declare your dispatch functions and Hub operations</h3>
    If you write a dispatch function in a server, you have to <a
 href="basic_server.html#Step_4:_Write_and_incorporate_your_server_declarations">declare
  it using GAL_SERVER_OP</a> if you want the server to know about it. Similarly,
  if you want the Hub to know that the server has a dispatch function, you
 have to declare it in the appropriate <a
 href="pgm_intro.html#OPERATIONS:">OPERATIONS:  directive entry</a>.    
<h3> Make sure your messages are distinct</h3>
    The Hub programming language is very forgiving, in the sense that it
will  ignore or pay attention to messages which invoke programs depending
on the  keys in the message. So, for example, you could use <tt>main</tt>
for the  name of every message you send to the Hub via <a
 href="../reference/adding.html#GalSS_EnvWriteFrame">GalSS_EnvWriteFrame</a>()
  or <a href="../reference/adding.html#GalSS_EnvDispatchFrame">GalSS_EnvDispatchFrame</a>(),
  and use the keys in the message to decide what to do with them. However,
 this strategy makes the program file extremely hard to read. We have learned,
 from studying MIT's program files, that it's much more straightforward to
 distinguish your messages at least by the server that sent them. Our <a
 href="../../../contrib/MITRE/demos/docs/toy-travel-tut.html">toy travel example</a>
demostrates this strategy.    
<h3> Use the listener-in-Hub capability at least for your UI elements</h3>
    The easiest way to manage UI connections to the Hub (that is, GUIs, audio 
 servers, and the like) is to have them contact the Hub instead of the other 
 way around. If you set things up using the <a
 href="../advanced/hub_listener.html">listener-in-Hub</a> capability, you'll 
 be able to have UI elements contact the Hub on an ad-hoc basis, and there 
 are simple hooks for keeping the sessions separate as well. You can use listener-in-Hub
 for all your server connections, if you choose, but it's most desirable
for  UI elements.    
<p> </p>
     
<hr width="100%">    
<h2> <a name="The_Builtin_server"></a>The Builtin server</h2>
    The <a href="../../servers/builtin.html">Builtin</a> server is a special 
 server which is implemented as part of the Hub itself. This server is always 
 available, which means that it doesn't need to be declared in the Hub program 
 file. It has special access to the internals of the Hub operations, so that 
 it can be used to provide information about the Hub state (such as the servers 
 which are available, or the state of various namespaces). The Builtin server 
 is a grab bag of functionality, and we're not going to talk about most of 
 it. We'll concentrate here on a small number of potentially interesting and
 relevant functions.    
<h3> nop</h3>
    The dispatch function <tt>nop</tt> is a no-op. It simply returns its
input  frame. The reason you might want to use <tt>nop</tt> is that there
may be  some times when you may want simply to update a key-value pair in
a namespace  when a certain condition is met:    
<blockquote><tt>RULE: :output_parse == "PARSE_FAILED" --&gt; Builtin.nop</tt>
    <br>
     <tt>OUT: (:parse_failed 1)</tt></blockquote>
    The Hub scripting language probably ought to provide a case where you 
can  omit the operation, but for now, using <tt>nop</tt> is the appropriate 
strategy.    
<h3> call_program</h3>
    This dispatch function can be used to construct a new message to the
Hub.  The name of the program should be passed in as the value of the <tt>:program</tt>
  key. All the other key-value pairs passed to <tt>call_program</tt> will
appear in the new message. The new message will be processed like any other
new message; it will either invoke a program with the appropriate name, be
relayed to a server which supports an operation with the appropriate name,
or be discarded. This dispatch function will also return the result of the
executed program, if requested.    
<p>For example, the toy travel demo unifies the processing of its typed input 
 and the "output" of the Recognizer server by routing both to the same program 
 (named <tt>UserInput</tt>), as follows: </p>
     
<blockquote><tt>PROGRAM: FromRecognizer</tt>          
  <p><tt>RULE: :input_string --&gt; Builtin.call_program</tt> <br>
     <tt>IN: (:program "UserInput") :input_string</tt> <br>
     <tt>OUT: none!</tt></p>
   </blockquote>
    In this example, no result is requested, so none will be provided.  
 
<h3> new_session</h3>
    This dispatch function creates or resets a session. For creation, this
 dispatch function is really not needed, because sessions are created automatically 
 when they're mentioned, but this dispatch function is crucial if you try 
to reuse a session ID. For instance, you might be running a system which will
never have multiple simultaneous users, and you might be using the default 
 session as your session every time. <b>This is not recommended</b>. However, 
 if you must do this, new_session will reset the current session state and 
 start a new log file in the appropriate circumstances (i.e., if you're calling 
 <tt>new_session</tt> on this session for the second time, or later).    
<h3> end_session</h3>
    This dispatch function ends the current session. We discussed in the
<a href="session_tutorial.html#Ending_sessions">session lesson</a> how important 
 this is.    
<h3> destroy</h3>
    This dispatch function destroys the current token. We alluded to this 
dispatch  function when we talked about the special <tt>destroy! </tt>value 
of OUT:  in the <a href="pgm_intro.html#The_destroy!_value">program file 
tutorial</a>.  This method of destroying the token is somewhat less efficient 
than the OUT:  value, but it's an available alternative.    
<h3> hub_exit</h3>
    This dispatch function causes the Hub to exit, in case you ever want
this  sort of thing under program control.    
<p> </p>
     
<hr width="100%">    
<h2> <a name="Debugging_strategies"></a>Debugging strategies</h2>
    There are a number of things you can do to make it easier for you to
understand  what's going on (and what's going wrong) with your end-to-end
system. In this section, we describe some of them briefly.    
<h3> Builtin.hub_break</h3>
    This Builtin dispatch function suspends the execution of the Hub and
enters  a loop where you can inspect the state of various namespaces. We
used this  functionality to halt the Hub in our initial lesson on the <a
 href="../../../contrib/MITRE/demos/docs/toy-travel-tut.html">toy travel demo</a>.
If there's a Hub program rule that isn't getting fired and you think it should
be (or vice versa), you may find it useful to insert a call to <tt>Builtin.hub_break</tt>
at the appropriate point in your Hub program.    
<h3> The <tt>-debug</tt> argument to the Hub</h3>
    You can also access this same breakpoint behavior by using the <tt>-debug</tt> 
 <a href="../reference/hub.html#The_Hub">Hub command line argument</a>. This
 argument will cause the Hub to break after it sends each new message. You
 can shut this behavior off as the Hub is running if you choose to, by typing
 a capital C at the breakpoint prompt.    
<h3> Exploit your verbosity settings</h3>
    As we described in the <a
 href="../../../contrib/MITRE/demos/docs/toy-travel-tut.html#Controlling_how_much_you_see">toy
  travel demo lesson</a>, the Hub and servers support 6 levels of verbose
output, from nothing (level 0) to 6 (everything). These levels can be controlled
by setting the <tt><a href="../advanced/util.html#Printing">GAL_VERBOSE</a></tt>
  environment variable in your shell, or by using the <tt>-verbosity</tt>
command line arguments for the Hub and servers. The default is 3. If you
choose a level above 3, you'll get more information. Among the relevant values
are:    
<ul>
    <li> At level 4, you'll get a full printout of the message traffic in 
the  servers instead of the truncated messages with ellipses that you usually 
see.</li>
     <li> At level 6, you'll get the actual XDR encodings which are written 
 to and read from the servers and the Hub. It's not necessarily advisable 
to use this level if you have broker connections, since the broker data encoding 
 will be dumped as well.</li>
       
</ul>
       
<h3> MODE: pedantic</h3>
    In normal circumstances, the Hub will report errors in program files, 
but  a number of those errors will not cause the Hub to exit (for instance, 
a reference to an undeclared operation). If you insert the directive entry 
"<a href="../reference/pgm.html#MODE:">MODE: pedantic</a>" into your program 
 file, the Hub will always exit when it encounters these errors. This is a
 good way to find typos in your server and operation names.    
<h3> Fake desktop audio</h3>
    If you're building a telephony application, we strongly recommend constructing 
 versions of your audio server to handle desktop audio, and one to handle 
text I/O. Both of these should present as similar as possible a set of functionality 
 as the telephony server. MITRE hopes to make its open-source cross-platform
audio server available in the next release of the Open Source Toolkit.  
 
<p> </p>
     
<hr width="100%">    
<h2> <a name="Avoiding_trouble"></a>Avoiding trouble</h2>
        
<h3> Consider using the -assert command line argument</h3>
    If a server is starting up a listener for Hub connections (as opposed 
to  using the <a href="../advanced/hub_listener.html">listener-in-Hub</a> 
capability),  it will use the first port it finds available. If the requested 
port isn't  available, it will try the requested port + 1, and so on until 
it finds a  port it can start up on. This behavior can sometimes lead to unexpected
consequences.  For instance, if you start up a server on port 6000 and there's
already a  server running on that port, the new server will happily start
up on port  6001. If you don't notice this, your Hub may try to contact the
wrong server,  or you might not be able to make a connection at all. One
way to avoid this  is to use the <tt>-assert </tt><a
 href="../reference/adding.html#Initialization">server command line argument</a>, 
 which will force the server to exit if the requested port isn't available.
    
<h3> Don't forget about the initial token</h3>
    You may remember that we talked about the <a
 href="how_it_works.html#First_new_message_source:_the_initial_token">initial
  token</a> when we talked about how to send new messages to the Hub. This
 initial token can be specified using the <a
 href="../reference/pgm.html#Initial_token">INITIAL_TOKEN:</a> directive entry
in the Hub program file. While we don't really recommend using the initial
token for anything besides global initializations and simple tests and examples,
you should be aware that you don't have complete control over the appearance
and content of the initial token. In particular, for historical reasons,
even if you don't specify INITIAL_TOKEN:, an initial token will be created
if there's a program named <tt>main</tt>. If your <tt>main</tt> program is
being invoked unexpectedly on a token with token index 0, you should check
to see if there is some accidental overlap between the keys you expect and
the keys in the default initial token.    
<h3> Turn off the Hub pacifier</h3>
    In all of our exercises, we've used the <tt>-suppress_pacifier</tt> command 
 line argument to the Hub. If this flag is not provided, the Hub will print 
 out a period (".") each second when it is idle. If you're trying to scan 
back through the Hub output, many displays (X terminals and the process monitor, 
 for instance) will cause problems because they scroll to the end whenever 
 there's output. In the process monitor, you can press the "Pause" button; 
 but in general, if you're having problems with this, use <tt>-suppress_pacifier</tt>.
      
<h3> <tt>Builtin.increment_utterance</tt> and logging</h3>
    You may recall when we talked about the <a
 href="logging_tutorial.html#Looking_at_the_log">content of the Hub log</a>,
 we told you to ignore the features <tt>:BEGIN_UTT</tt> and the reference 
to <tt>-01</tt> throughout the log. These elements have to do with the way 
the Hub was originally designed to handle utterance boundaries. The Hub has 
an utterance counter, which can be incremented using the Builtin dispatch 
function <tt>increment_utterance</tt>. The original designers assumed that 
a Communicator-compliant system would begin with a presentation to the user 
(utterance -1), followed by a call to <tt>increment_utterance</tt>, and then 
a call to <tt>increment_utterance</tt> each time the Hub program writer determined 
an utterance boundary was reached.    
<p>The utterance counter has had three uses in the history of the Hub: </p>
     
<ul>
    <li> It is used to index entries in a Hub-internal database which is
local  to each session. You can use the <a
 href="../reference/pgm.html#STORE:">STORE:</a>   directive entry to store
key-value pairs in a frame associated with the current utterance counter
in the current session, and use the <a
 href="../reference/pgm.html#RETRIEVE:">RETRIEVE:</a> directive entry to retrieve
key-value pairs from a frame associated with (by default) the <b>previous</b> 
 utterance counter in the current session. If you have a strong commitment 
 to stateless servers, you may find this functionality useful as a storage 
 device. However, it clearly depends on the utterance counter being incremented; 
 otherwise, you'd just be able to use the session namespace.</li>
     <li> The original MIT audio server used this counter to help name the
 audio files logged for the given session. We believe there are better ways
 to do this; in particular, we recommend that the audio server determine
its  own file names, and report them to the Hub so that they can be logged
in the Hub log.</li>
     <li> Incrementing the utterance counter has the effect of ending an
utterance  in the log and starting a new one. When we designed the XML DTD
for the     <a href="logging_tutorial.html#Working_with_logs">XML version
of the Hub log</a>, we introduced a tag called GC_TURN which correspond this
boundary. However, we subsequently moved to a different model of introducing
"meaningful" information into the log, through a system of annotation rules
which "decorate" existing tags with meaningful landmarks which indicate things
like the beginning and end of turns. This was because we didn't want people
to have to write their program files a particular way in order to guarantee
logs that could be scored. As a result, the GC_TURN tag is mostly ignored
in the log analysis process, with a single exception: it's possible to write
annotation rules which rely on GC_TURN as a scoping device, and under some
circumstances, it's difficult to write your rules if you don't have enough
scoping levels. This is a flaw which ought to be addressed eventually, but
has not been yet.</li>
       
</ul>
    In summary, unless you want to use STORE: and RETRIEVE:, you can usually 
 ignore the utterance counter. But you should be aware of the issues involved.
    
<h3> Other historical artifacts</h3>
    There are a few other elements which are worth mentioning which may surprise 
 you or can get you into trouble:    
<ul>
    <li> The frame type (the <tt>c</tt> at the beginning of the frame's string 
 representation) is a relic of how frames were originally used (and are still 
 used in the MIT servers): as hierarchical representations of parses and semantic
 interpretations. The c stands for "clause"; there are also predicates ("p")
 and topics ("q" for quantificational element). Frames without the leading
 type (e.g., <tt>{ foo :bar 1 }</tt>) are interpreted as clauses. We only
use the clause type in the infrastructure proper.</li>
     <li> The Galaxy Communicator header include line for C code should always 
 be <tt>-I$GC_HOME/include</tt>,&nbsp; and the main header file should always 
 be <tt>#include &lt;galaxy/galaxy_all.h&gt;</tt>. This is because all the 
 Galaxy Communicator header files assume that the include lines end with the
     <tt>include/</tt> directory, and will include other files which are
referenced  as, say, <tt>#include &lt;galaxy/util.h&gt;</tt>. This is a historical
idiosyncracy  which will never be changed.</li>
     <li> Finally, you may wonder why the second argument of dispatch functions 
 is a <tt>void *</tt>, rather than a call environment pointer. This, again, 
 is a historical relic, but because of the vagaries of typing in C and the 
 base of installed code already finished, it's something that we can't change.</li>
       
</ul>
