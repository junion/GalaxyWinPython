<p>Up to this point, all the communication between servers has been mediated 
 by the Hub. This arrangement has its advantages: for instance, the Hub provides 
 a central location for flow of control and routing. However, it also has 
its disadvantages: in order for a message to get from one server to another, 
it has to be decoded, analyzed, and reconstructed in the Hub. While this process
appears to be quite efficient, there are circumstances in which you might
prefer to send data directly: for example, in situations involving high bandwidth
or streaming, such as audio input or output. </p>
     
<p>To support this alternative, the Galaxy Communicator infrastructure supports 
 a peer-to-peer connection called a <b>broker</b>. The Hub mediates the establishment 
 of this connection, but all data which flows through the connection goes 
directly from server to server. In this lesson, we'll learn how to set up 
a broker connection and how it works. </p>

<h2> <a name="Recognizer,_Synthesizer_and_Audio"></a>Recognizer, Synthesizer 
 and Audio</h2>
    Up to this point, we've examined four servers in the toy travel demo: 
the  Parser, Backend and Generator servers, which represent the simplest type
of server, and the Dialogue server, which represents the next level of complexity.
 The first three servers simply send responses to dispatch functions, while
 the Dialogue server sends new messages to the Hub and occasionally waits
for the response. The last three servers take advantage of all these tools,
and furthermore interact with each other via broker connections.    
<p>In addition, the Audio server also exhibits the complexities of UI programming, 
 which we'll explore in the next lesson. </p>
     
<p> </p>
     
<hr width="100%">    
<h2> <a name="Brokering_in_four_steps"></a>Brokering in four steps</h2>
    The setup and operation of brokers can be broken down into four steps.
 We'll describe and illustrate these steps briefly, and then look at some
code. We'll focus on the interaction between the Synthesizer and Audio servers 
 as an example.    
<h3> <a name="Step_1:_Establish_the_broker_listener"></a>Step 1: Establish 
 the broker listener</h3>
    In the first step, the server which will be the source of the broker
data  establishes a listener for the broker. This listener, in most cases,
is the  same listener that's listening for connections from the Hub; the
protocol  is constructed so that the listener can distinguish between the
two types  of connections. The server assigns each broker a unique ID, so
that the server  can listen for multiple brokers simultaneously. The server
also assigns each  broker a timeout; it will accept multiple connections
for the broker, until  the timeout is reached.    
<center><img src="../../images/BrokerSetup.jpg" nosave="" height="407"
 width="527">
   </center>
        
<h3> <a name="Step_2:_Notify_the_Hub_and_client"></a>Step 2: Notify the Hub 
 and client</h3>
    In the second step, the source server sends a new message to the Hub
which  contains the broker contact information. This information consists
of the  host, port, datatype and unique ID associated with this particular
broker,  and is encapsulated in an object called a <b>broker proxy</b>. The
message  which contains the proxy is a message like any other, and can contain
additional  information (such as encoding format and sample rate for audio).
   
<center><img src="../../images/BrokerMessage.jpg" nosave="" height="407"
 width="527">
   </center>
        
<h3> <a name="Step_3:_Establish_the_broker_connection,_transmit_data"></a>Step
  3: Establish the broker connection, transmit data</h3>
    When the target server receives this information, it establishes a connection 
 to the source server using information in the proxy, and establishes a callback 
 to receive the data. The source server can now send data over the connection, 
 and the callback will be invoked in the target server whenever data is received.
    
<center><img src="../../images/BrokerConnection.jpg" nosave=""
 height="407" width="527">
   </center>
        
<h3> <a name="Step_4:_Process_data,_shut_down_broker_listener"></a>Step 4: 
 Process data, shut down broker listener</h3>
    Finally, when the source server is done sending data, it notifies the 
target  server that it's done, and the broker connection is terminated. The 
target  server does whatever it wants to do with the data (e.g., send audio 
to the  audio device). When the source server's broker reaches its timeout, 
it stops  accepting connections for that broker; when all the connections 
for the broker  are done, the source server shuts down the broker.

   </center>
    Now that we've seen these steps in the abstract, let's take a look at 
each  one of them in detail.    
<p> </p>
     
<hr width="100%">    
<h2> <a name="Brokering_details"></a>Brokering details</h2>
        
<h3> <a name="Source_server:_broker_setup,_message_dispatch"></a>Source server: 
 broker setup, message dispatch</h3>
    In the first and second brokering steps, the source server sets up a
broker  listener and sends a message to the Hub announcing the broker. Here's
how  that happens. <br>
   <img src="../../images/BrokerServer.jpg" nosave="" height="455"
 width="815">
    <br>
   There's more than one way to do this, but in this particular case, we
use  the function <a
 href="../reference/brokering.html#GalSS_ProxifyObjectType">GalSS_ProxifyObjectType</a>. 
 This function creates the broker listener, and wraps a proxy around it. The
 first argument of this function is the call environment. The connection this
 call environment contains, and the server it's associated with, will host
 the broker and its listener. The second argument is the type of data we'll
 send across this broker connection; in this case, it's arrays of 16-bit integers.
 The next argument is how often (or whether) to allow the toplevel Communicator
 loop to poll this broker to see if there's anything to do; 0 means use the
 default poll value. The fourth argument is the timeout, in seconds; after
 this amount of time, the broker will stop accepting new connections.<br>
     
<p>After the new proxy is created, it's inserted into the frame like any other
data, and the frame is sent to the Hub and then freed, just like any other
message. </p>
     
<h3> <a name="Hub:_broker_client_notification"></a>Hub: broker client notification</h3>
    The Hub portion of the process is the simplest, and you can probably
guess  what it looks like:    
<blockquote><tt>PROGRAM: FromSynthesizer</tt>          
  <p><tt>RULE: :proxy --&gt; Audio.Play</tt> <br>
     <tt>IN: :proxy :encoding_format :sample_rate</tt></p>
  </blockquote>
  The Hub matches the incoming message with the appropriate program, shown 
here, and checks the rule. The <tt>:proxy</tt> key is present. So the rule 
fires, and the relevant  data is sent to the <tt>Audio.Play</tt> dispatch 
function.    
<h3> <a name="Target_server:_set_up_broker_client,_establish_callback"></a>Target
  server: set up broker client, establish callback</h3>
    When the Audio server invokes the <tt>Audio.Play</tt> dispatch function, 
 it creates a broker client, as follows: <br>
   <img src="../../images/BrokerClient1.jpg" nosave="" height="311"
 width="767" alt="">
    <br>
 Again, there are a few ways to do this, but here we use the function <a
 href="../reference/brokering.html#GalSS_Unproxify">GalSS_Unproxify</a>. This
function creates the broker client and establishes the callbacks. It requires
a call environment object (in case  the callback needs the environment to
write new messages to the Hub), the proxy, and three possible callbacks: one
to handle the data, one which is called when the data transfer is done, and
one to be called if the connection aborts before completing. (There are also
a few other arguments we won't discuss.) Notice that we copied the broker 
proxy before we established the connection; this is because, like all other 
data in frames, the original proxy will be freed when the dispatch function 
exits and the incoming message is freed.<br>
 
<p>At this point, the source and target servers have established a broker
 connection, and the broker client can begin to consume data.   </p>
 
<h3> <a name="About_broker_data"></a>About broker data</h3>
    When we discussed <a href="frame_intro.html#What's_in_a_frame">frames
 and objects</a>, we talked about the object types that could appear in frames,
 and concentrated on frames, strings, integers and lists. We <a
 href="frame_intro.html#Summary">suggested</a> at that point that there were 
 <a href="../reference/frame.html#Object_Types">many other datatypes</a> 
which could appear in frames, including arrays of integers of various sizes. 
 Any type that can appear in a frame can be sent across a broker connection, 
 and vice versa, but we won't be looking at frames, string, integers and lists
 in our broker example; we'll be looking at arrays of integers.    
<p>When data is written to a broker server, it is encoded and cached in an 
 output queue. If any broker clients are currently connected, it is also written
 to the client; and when a new client connects, the server transmits the
contents  of the output queue to the new client. In other words, all clients
which connect to the broker server are guaranteed to see all the same data
in the same order, no matter when they connect. This is one of the reasons
that broker servers are set up to expire; if a broker server didn't expire,
it would never be possible to free its output queue. </p>
     
<h3> <a name="The_two_ends_of_the_broker_connection"></a>The two ends of the
broker connection</h3>
    On the source server side, the server writes data to the broker, and
then  indicates that it's done, approximately as follows:    
<blockquote><tt>&nbsp; void *data; <br>
 &nbsp; int num_samples; <br>
 &nbsp; GalSS_BrokerProxy *bp; <br>
 &nbsp; SynthesisRecord *s;<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 &nbsp; /*&nbsp;... */<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 &nbsp; data = PollSynthesis(s, &amp;num_samples);   <br>
 &nbsp; while (data) { <br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>GalSS_ProxyArrayAdd(bp, data, num_samples);  
   </b><br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; free(data); <br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; data = PollSynthesis(s, &amp;num_samples);   <br>
     &nbsp; }<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
     &nbsp; if (SynthesisIsDone(s)) { <br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>GalSS_ProxyDone(bp); </b><br>
     &nbsp; }<br>
 &nbsp; /*&nbsp;... */</tt>                            </blockquote>
    There are two functions involved in this example.    
<ul>
    <li> The function <a
 href="../reference/brokering.html#GalSS_ProxyArrayAdd">GalSS_ProxyArrayAdd</a> 
writes array data to a broker. The data does not need to be typed, because 
the broker proxy is already typed (remember, we're writing arrays of 16-bit 
integers). The second argument is the array of data, and the third argument 
is the number of elements in the array. This function can be called as many 
times as desired.</li>
     <li> When there's no more data to send, the function <a
 href="../reference/brokering.html#GalSS_ProxyDone">GalSS_ProxyDone</a>  must
be called. This call causes a special message to be sent over the broker 
connection which indicates that all data has been written. If this function 
 is not called, the broker clients will never terminate and disconnect, and 
 the broker server will never die.</li>
       
</ul>
    On the target server side, the data callback function is invoked each 
time  a block of data is received (each block corresponds to a single call 
to GalSS_ProxyArrayAdd). The data callback function looks  approximately like
this:    
<blockquote><tt>static void __AudioOutputCallback(GalSS_Environment *env,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gal_ObjectType 
o_type,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gal_Object 
elt, void *caller_data)<br>
 {<br>
 &nbsp; AudioPkg *p = (AudioPkg *) caller_data;<br>
 &nbsp; int n_samples = 0;<br>
 &nbsp; void *data = Gal_Int16Value(elt, &amp;n_samples);<br>
 &nbsp; <br>
 &nbsp; printf("[Audio data to user (%d samples)]\n", n_samples);<br>
 &nbsp; fflush(stdout);<br>
 &nbsp; PlayAudio(p-&gt;device, data, n_samples);<br>
 &nbsp; Gal_FreeObject(elt);<br>
 }</tt></blockquote>
 Each data callback function has the same signature. The first argument is 
the environment passed to GalSS_Unproxify. The second argument is the <a
 href="frame_intro.html#What's_in_a_frame">data type</a> of the broker proxy.
The third object is a Gal_Object corresponding to the data, and the final
argument is caller data which was passed to GalSS_Unproxify, in case you
need to refer to your own structures.    
<p>So when the target server receives a block of data, it invokes the data 
 callback. The data is allocated as a new Gal_Object before it's passed to 
the data callback function, so once it's done with the data, it frees it. 
This happens for each block of data (that is, each GalSS_ProxyArrayAdd call 
on the source side), until the broker client receives the termination message, 
at which point it will do whatever it's supposed to do when it's done,  and 
terminate. </p>
     
<h3> <a name="An_example"></a>An example</h3>
    Let's watch a broker in action. This is slightly complicated by the fact 
 that the unit tester cannot host broker servers or clients. So we need to 
 use the unit tester, acting as a server, to send a message to the Hub which 
 will cause the Synthesizer server to produce a broker connection. This is 
 actually pretty simple; we'll just send a <tt>Synthesizer.Synthesize</tt> 
 message to the Hub, and populate its program file with the program we saw 
 <a href="#Hub:_broker_client_notification">here</a>, to handle the new message
from the Synthesizer server.    
<blockquote><b><tt>[Brokering exercise 1]<br>
  <br>
Unix</tt></b>:<br>
          
  <p><tt>%&nbsp;process_monitor $GC_HOME/tutorial/brokering/synth.config<br>
  </tt></p>
  <p><tt><b>Windows:</b><br>
  </tt></p>
  <p><tt>C:\&gt; </tt><tt>python %PM_DIR%\process_monitor.py %GC_HOME%\tutorial\brokering\synth.config</tt><br>
  </p>
   </blockquote>
    Select "Process Control --&gt;&nbsp;Restart all", then select "Send new 
 message"&nbsp;in the unit tester. Select the message named <tt>Synthesizer.Synthesize</tt>,
  and press OK. You'll see the result in the Audio pane:    
<blockquote><b><tt>[Audio client pane]</tt></b><tt></tt>          
  <p><tt>[Audio data to user (1024 samples)]</tt> <br>
     <tt>[Audio data to user (1024 samples)]</tt> <br>
     <tt>[Audio data to user (1024 samples)]</tt> <br>
     <tt>[Audio data to user (1024 samples)]</tt> <br>
     <tt>[Audio data to user (1024 samples)]</tt> <br>
     <tt>[Audio data to user (1024 samples)]</tt> <br>
     <tt>[Audio data to user (1024 samples)]</tt> <br>
     <tt>[Audio data to user (1024 samples)]</tt> <br>
     <tt>[Audio data to user (1024 samples)]</tt> <br>

     <tt>[Audio data to user (184 samples)]</tt> <br>
     <tt>[Audio data to user is finalized (14520 samples).]</tt></p>
   </blockquote>
    Each of these printouts corresponds to a single call to the data callback 
 function. The Hub shows how the information was conveyed from the source 
server to the target server:    
<blockquote><b><tt>[Hub pane]</tt></b><tt></tt>          
  <p><tt>----------------[&nbsp; 3]----------------------<br>

   </blockquote>
    The <tt>FromSynthesizer</tt> message constructed by the Synthesizer server 
 contains the proxy, and the program shown <a
 href="#Hub:_broker_client_notification">here</a> sends the appropriate 
message to the Audio server. Finally, the Synthesizer pane shows the evidence 
 of the broker client connecting, the unique ID&nbsp;matching, and the transmission 
 of the special conclusion message:    
<blockquote><b><tt>[Synthesizer pane]</tt></b><tt></tt>
