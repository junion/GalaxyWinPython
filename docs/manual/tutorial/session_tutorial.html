<p>Before we look at the final details of putting together an end-to-end system,
there's a subject which we've mentioned numerous times but have yet to cover:
sorting interactions into sessions. In this lesson, we'll learn what sessions
are, how they're created, how they're managed, and what they can do for you.

<h2> <a name="What_sessions_are"></a>What sessions are</h2>
    At various points throughout this tutorial, we've referred to the notion 
 of <b>session</b>:    
<ul>
    <li> In our toy travel interaction, we saw <a
 href="../../../contrib/MITRE/demos/docs/toy-travel-tut.html#Starting_the_interaction">reports
  in the IO monitor</a> which referred to input and output within a particular
  session.</li>
     <li> We saw that the unit tester utility has a <a
 href="../../../contrib/MITRE/tools/docs/unit_tester_tut.html#Starting_the_unit_tester_as_a_Hub">typein
  window</a> for session IDs, and a radio button to lock the session (whatever
  that means)</li>
     <li> We saw that one of the <a
 href="pgm_intro.html#Rules_and_namespaces">namespaces</a> in the Hub refers
 to the session.</li>
     <li> We saw that the <a
 href="errors.html#Environments_and_message_returns">call environment</a> 
 argument to dispatch functions contains the current session as part of its 
 contextual information.</li>
     <li> We saw that the session ID turns up in the <a
 href="logging_tutorial.html#Looking_at_the_log">Hub log</a>.</li>
       
</ul>
    A session is a interaction between the user and system, with a clear
beginning  and end. For instance, when a user calls a system on the phone
and the system  answers, that's the beginning of that session with the user;
when the user  or system hangs up, that's the end of the session. Sessions
are distinguished  by strings called <b>session IDs</b>, which we've seen
referred to in the  Hub log and the unit tester.    
<p>Sessions distinguish users from each other and group applications associated 
 with the same users together. So a single Hub might support multiple users, 
 each using different dedicated channels (such as audio), and multimodal interactions
 by each user, using multiple dedicated applications (say, a GUI and audio
 channel): </p>
     
<p><img src="../../images/Sessions.jpg" nosave="" height="167"
 width="839">
    </p>
     
<p> </p>
     
<hr width="100%">    
<h2> <a name="Why_use_sessions"></a>Why use sessions?</h2>
    There are a number of reasons that sessions are valuable.    
<p>First, they provide the boundaries on separate interactions. There's a 
 one-to-one mapping between sessions and Hub log files when logging is enabled 
 in the Hub, and this allows us to sort out statistics about user interactions 
 appropriately for scoring and analysis. </p>
     
<p>Second, they provide a, well, session-level memory state in the Hub (i.e., 
 the session namespace) for each user interaction which spans all the tokens 
 generated for that user interaction. So if a Hub program needs to record 
crucial information about the interaction (say, the interaction language, 
or the media available for output), the session is the appropriate place (and,
perhaps, the only appropriate place) to store it. This is especially important
if your system anticipates supporting multiple simultaneous users.  </p>
     
<p>Third, and most dramatic, sessions provide a way of controlling the eligibility 
 of service providers in the Hub. Servers can lock themselves to particular 
 sessions (we'll talk about this in a minute) so that they're constrained 
to send messages to the Hub only for a particular session, or (more important) 
 to receive messages associated only with a particular session. Imagine, for
 a moment, if this were not the case, and the system had two simultaneous 
users. If we could not use sessions to distinguish between the various UI 
elements, and one user provided some input, we wouldn't necessarily be able 
to guarantee which user received the response! This is because if the response 
is a new message, rather than a message reply to the original input, the system
would try to select an appropriate UI element to handle the output, and it
wouldn't be able to tell which UI element was associated with which user.
You may respond, "Well, why doesn't it just keep track?", and the answer is:
that's what sessions do. </p>
     
<p>We can see this behavior by using the unit tester. The unit tester allows 
 you to specify the session associated with a new message, and also optionally 
 allows you to lock the session. If we don't set the lock and we have two 
unit tester servers connected to the same Hub (say, to the toy travel demo), 
it should be random which server receives the response to any input from either
server. And indeed, that's exactly what happens. </p>
     
<blockquote><tt><b>[Sessions exercise 1]</b><br>
    <br>
    <b>Unix:</b><br>
    </tt>          
  <p><tt>% process_monitor $GC_HOME/tutorial/sessions/unit-tester.config<br>
    </tt></p>
       
  <p><tt><b>Windows:</b><br>
    </tt></p>
       
  <p><tt>C:\&gt; python %PM_DIR%\process_monitor.py %GC_HOME%\tutorial\sessions\unit-tester.config</tt><br>
    </p>
   </blockquote>
    Select "Process Control --&gt; Restart all". Two unit testers should
start  up. In each of them, press "Send new message", and then select the
first message (the one named <tt>UserInput</tt>), and then OK. Repeat this
process several times. You'll notice that the reply doesn't come back to
the unit tester that sent the original message. In each case, the unit tester
you interacted with will have the following in its interaction history: 
  
<blockquote><b><tt>[Interaction History pane]</tt></b>          
  <p><tt>[Sending: new message]</tt> <br>
     <tt>{c UserInput</tt> <br>
     <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; :input_string "I WANT TO FLY FROM BOSTON TO LOS ANGELES"
  }</tt></p>
   </blockquote>
    And one or the other of the interaction history panes will have the response 
 in its interaction history:    
<blockquote><b><tt>[Interaction history pane]</tt></b>          
  <p><tt>[Received: new message]</tt> <br>
     <tt>{c UI.Print</tt> <br>
     <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; :session_id "Default"</tt> <br>
     <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; :output_string "American Airlines flight 115 leaves 
at  11:44 AM, and United flight 436 leaves at 2:05 PM" }</tt></p>
   </blockquote>
    However, which interaction history gets the response depends on which 
one  started first, and some other factors.    
<p>Now, repeat the procedure, but this time type "Session1" in the "Session 
 ID" entry box of the first unit tester, and "Session 2" in the "Session ID"
entry box of the second, and press the "Lock session" button before you press
OK. It may already say "Default"; delete it if it does (more on this in a
minute.) (You'll only have to type "Session1" or "Session2" the first time;
more on this in a minute too). As long as you've provided a session ID and
locked the session, the response should always come back to the same unit
tester. </p>
     
<p>Select "File --&gt; Quit" to end this exercise. </p>
     
<p>Locks are a little complicated. You can control which dimensions of the 
 message traffic are locked, and whether the lock is permanent or not. You 
 can find more details about locks in the <a
 href="../advanced/hub_properties.html#GalSS_EnvSetSession">Hub properties
  documentation</a>. </p>
     
<p> </p>
     
<hr width="100%">    
<h2> <a name="How_sessions_propagate"></a>How sessions propagate</h2>
    So why did the "Session ID" box say "Default", and why did we only have 
 to type "Session1" or "Session2" the first time? First, <tt>Default</tt> 
is the name of  the default session, which is used when no session is specified. 
When a new  message arrives at the Hub, it is assigned a session to the resulting 
token,  either one it's requested (more on this in a minute) or <tt>Default</tt>.
  Then the Hub processes this token. If the Hub sends a message to a server,
  and that server sends a new message as a result, the chances are overwhelming
  that the new message ought to be associated with the same session as the
 original message that was sent. For instance, in the toy travel demo, the
 user input is ultimately routed to the Dialogue server which (as we saw
in  the <a href="new_messages.html">new messages</a> lesson) sends a new
message  to the Hub which constitutes the system's response. This response
is part  of the same session (user interaction) as the user input:    
<center>    
<p><img src="../../images/PercolateSession.jpg" nosave="" height="407"
 width="695">
   </p>
   </center>
        
<p>This is accomplished as follows. When the Hub sends a message to a server, 
 it sends the current session ID of the current token along with the message, 
 which is incorporated into the call environment. Whenever a user writes a
 new message through a call environment which has a session ID, the new message
 will automatically be associated with that session. In this way, session
IDs automatically percolate from token to token: <br>
   <img src="../../images/SessionSupport.jpg" nosave="" height="191"
 width="719">
    <br>
   The call environment serves this purpose in multiple situations.For instance, 
 we saw in the <a
 href="broker_tutorial.html#Target_server:_set_up_broker_client,_establish_callback">brokering
  lesson</a> that the broker client is set up with a call environment, just
  in case the client has to send a new message to the Hub when it's done.
This happens in the toy travel demo, when the Audio server sends a message
to the recognizer, which receives the audio via a broker client and ultimately
  sends a new message from the broker callback containing the recognized
string.  This recognition result is part of the same session (user interaction)
as  the audio notification, and the call environment ensures that the same
session  is used: </p>
     
<center>    
<p><img src="../../images/BrokerSession.jpg" nosave="" height="383"
 width="623">
   </p>
   </center>
        
<p>So once a session is established, the call environment ensures that it 
 is preserved and propagated appropriately. </p>
     
<p> </p>
     
<hr width="100%">    
<h2> <a name="Creating_sessions"></a>Creating sessions</h2>
    So where do session IDs come from? Typically, they start with your UI 
elements,  since it's the user interaction which the sessions are encapsulating. 
   
<ul>
    <li> If your UI element is a server which the Hub has contacted, you
can  update the session ID in the call environment using the function <a
 href="../advanced/session.html#GalSS_EnvUpdateSessionID">GalSS_EnvUpdateSessionID</a>,
  or <a
 href="../advanced/hub_properties.html#GalSS_EnvModifySessionProperties">GalSS_EnvSetSession</a>
  to update the session ID and establish the session lock.</li>
     <li> If your UI element is a server which contacts the Hub, you can
use  the <tt>-session_id </tt><a
 href="../reference/adding.html#Initialization">command line argument</a> 
 to set a session ID for a given interaction. This command line argument establishes
 the session lock for you; you can get more details in the advanced documentation
 on <a href="../advanced/hub_listener.html">hub listeners</a>. You can also
 set the session ID programmatically before the server contacts the Hub;
this  is how the Audio server works in the toy travel demo, but the procedure
is  a little too complicated to discuss here.</li>
       
</ul>
    When the Hub receives a message with a session ID, it looks for a session 
 with that ID. If it doesn't find one, it creates it. So it's not necessary 
 to create a session explicitly; sessions are created in the Hub by virtue 
 of being mentioned.    
<p> </p>
     
<hr width="100%">    
<h2> <a name="Ending_sessions"></a>Ending sessions</h2>
    Once a session is created, it survives until it is explicitly ended.
There's  no inference, for instance, that if a particular UI element sends
a message  which causes a session to be created, and that UI element disconnects,
the  session is over. There are obvious situations where this inference would 
be wrong. For example, let's say the user wishes to suspend a session and 
resume later. The user could simply disconnect now and reconnect later, perhaps 
from a different location and a different UI element, as long as the same 
session ID is used.    
<p>It's important to end a session for all sorts of reasons, especially efficiency. 
 There's a lot of memory associated with the session, including the session 
 namespace and all the information related to session locks, and this memory 
 can't be freed until the session ends. It's also important to close the Hub
 log file, which remains open until the session ends. So it's important to
 end the session. </p>
     
<p>You can end a session by invoking the operation <tt>Builtin.end_session</tt>
  in the Hub. This dispatch function is implemented by the Builtin server,
 which we're going to discuss in the next (and final) lesson. If you look
at the Audio server, it sends a message to the Hub with this name when it
disconnects:  </p>
     
<blockquote><tt>/* ... */</tt> <br>
     <tt>&nbsp; case AUDIO_UNAVAILABLE:</tt> <br>
     <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /* The device shut down. End the session and
exit.  */</tt> <br>
     <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /* We ran out of inputs. Disconnect. */</tt>
  <br>
     <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; printf("Audio no longer available. Disconnecting.\n");</tt>
          
  <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /* First, end the session. */</tt> <br>
     <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>output_f = Gal_MakeFrame("Builtin.end_session",
  GAL_CLAUSE);</b></tt> <br>
     <b><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GalSS_EnvWriteFrame(p-&gt;env, output_f, 0);</tt></b>
    <br>
     <b><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gal_FreeFrame(output_f);</tt></b> </p>
           
  <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /* Next, shut down the connection. This ought</tt>
    <br>
     <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to reset the poll. */</tt>
  <br>
     <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GalIO_SetCommDone(GalSS_EnvComm(p-&gt;env));</tt>
    <br>
     <tt>/* ... */</tt></p>
   </blockquote>
    Assuming the Hub doesn't have a program named <tt>Builtin.end_session</tt>,
  when it receives this message, it will invoke the appropriate Bulitin server
  operation.

    In this lesson, we've learned all about sessions: what they are, why
to  use them, and how to create, manage and end them. In the next (and final) 
 lesson, we'll cover all the random odds and ends which you need to understand 
 to finally assemble an end-to-end system.
