covers more and more of the operation of the <a

we'll cover the remaining details of the toy travel demo, most of which have
to do with the operation of the Hub. </p>

  Once you've worked through this lesson, you can take a look at the <a
 href="../reference/logging.html">logging reference</a>.  
<p> </p>
 
<hr width="100%">  
<h2> <a name="Introducing_logging"></a>Introducing logging</h2>
  To introduce logging, we'll start by logging our little interaction with 
the Parse server from the <a
 href="../../../contrib/MITRE/tools/docs/unit_tester_tut.html#Starting_the_unit_tester_as_a_server">unit
 tester lesson</a>.  
<blockquote><b><tt>[Logging exercise 1]<br>
   <br>
 Unix:<br>
   </tt></b>    
  <p><tt>% process_monitor $GC_HOME/tutorial/logging/parse-server.config<br>
   </tt></p>
   
  <p><tt><b>Windows:</b><br>
   </tt></p>
   
  <p><tt>C:\&gt; python %PM_DIR%\process_monitor.py %GC_HOME%\tutorial\logging\parse-server.config</tt><br>
    </p>
     </blockquote>
  Start the Parser, then the Hub, and finally the unit tester. Press "Send 
new message", select the first message, select "Reply required" and then OK.
After the interaction, press the "Stop" button associated with the Hub pane,
and then select "File --&gt; Quit". You've now created a log.  
<p>Here's the relevant portion of the program file <tt>$GC_HOME/tutorial/logging/parse.pgm</tt>:
 </p>
 
<blockquote><tt>LOG_VERSION: "Parser, version 1"</tt>    
  <p><tt>;; This means that the log directory hierarchy</tt> <br>
   <tt>;; will start in the directory where the Hub is run.</tt> </p>
   
  <p><tt>LOG_DIR: .</tt> </p>
   
  <p><tt>TIMESTAMP: Parse UserInput</tt> </p>
   
  <p><tt>PROGRAM: UserInput</tt> </p>
   
  <p><tt>RULE: :input_string --&gt; Parser.Parse</tt> <br>
   <tt>IN: :input_string</tt> <br>
   <tt>OUT: :frame</tt> <br>
   <tt>LOG_IN: :input_string</tt> <br>
   <tt>LOG_OUT: :frame</tt></p>
 </blockquote>
  In the next few steps, we'll learn about the information in the program 
file which helps organize the log, and then we'll look at the log itself.
 
<p> </p>
 
<hr width="100%">  
<h2> <a name="Setting_up_the_log"></a>Setting up the log</h2>
  There are two lines in the program file which set up the log:  
<blockquote><tt>LOG_VERSION: "Parser, version 1"</tt>    
  <p><tt>;; ...</tt> </p>
   
  <p><tt>LOG_DIR: .</tt></p>
 </blockquote>
  The first line is optional. LOG_VERSION: is a directive which allows you 
to associate arbitrary names with your logs. These names are intended to correspond
to system or program file versions, so you can keep track of what to expect
in your log (for example, you may change the names of programs, dispatch
functions or keys in your system, and this might affect your ability to extract
the appropriate information from the logs for, say, summarization).  
<p>The second line is obligatory. Without a LOG_DIR: directive entry, the 
Hub will not create a log. The value of LOG_DIR: is where the log directory 
hierarchy should live. This value is interpreted relative to the directory 
where the Hub was started from. In this directory, the log can be found in 
<tt>sls/<i>date</i>/<i>counter</i>/sls-<i>date</i>-<i>counter</i>-hublog.txt</tt>,
 where <i><tt>date</tt></i> and <i><tt>counter</tt></i> guarantee a unique 
identifier for each log. (You can change the string <tt>sls</tt> by using 
the USER_ID: directive entry, but we won't cover this in the tutorial. See 
the <a href="../reference/logging.html">logging reference</a>.) </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<hr width="100%">  
<h2> <a name="Inserting_information_into_the_log"></a>Inserting information 
into the log</h2>
    
<h3> <a name="Logging_messages"></a>Logging messages</h3>
  You can log incoming new messages and their returns, and also outgoing
new messages and their returns. The TIMESTAMP: directive entry does this
for you:  
<blockquote><tt>TIMESTAMP: Parse UserInput</tt></blockquote>
  This entry covers both program names (incoming messages) and operation
names (outgoing messages). Each of these messages is recorded in the log
along with a timestamp in milliseconds:  
<center>  
<p><img src="../../images/Logging1.jpg" nosave="" height="527"
 width="623">
 </p>
 </center>
    
<h3> <a name="Logging_key-value_pairs"></a>Logging key-value pairs</h3>
  You can log key-value pairs using the LOG_IN: and LOG_OUT: directive entries. 
Here's what the rule which invokes the Parser server really looks like:  
<blockquote><tt>RULE: :input_string --&gt; Parser.Parse</tt> <br>
   <tt>IN: :input_string</tt> <br>
   <tt>LOG_IN: :input_string</tt> <br>
   <tt>OUT: :frame</tt> <br>
   <tt>LOG_OUT: :frame</tt></blockquote>
  This process can be illustrated as follows:  
<p><img src="../../images/Logging2.jpg" nosave="" height="383"
 width="695">
  </p>
 
<p>These two directive entries, like IN: and OUT:, have two namespaces, sort 
of. The source namespace for both these directive entries is the message (message
send for LOG_IN:, message return for LOG_OUT:), but the target "namespace" 
isn't really a namespace; all the data is written directly to the log. So 
you can map to different keys, or log from different namespaces, or log literals:
 </p>
 
<blockquote><tt>LOG_IN: (:string :input_string) (:user_id $in(:user_id global)) 
(:log_successful 1)</tt></blockquote>
  If you log key-value pairs for a message which isn't timestamped, the message 
will automatically be timestamped for you.  
<h3> <a name="Logging_audio"></a>Logging audio</h3>
  Since most audio is brokered and doesn't pass through the Hub, the Hub
can't log it. Up to now, in the Communicator program, logging of audio has
been left up to the individual audio servers. Your audio server should write
the audio to a file and then report the name of the file to the Hub, so that 
the Hub can log it. If the audio server doesn't share a file system with the
Hub executable, you may need to do some postprocessing to get the audio and
the logfile into a commonly accessible location.  
<p> </p>
 
<hr width="100%">  
<h2> <a name="Looking_at_the_log"></a>Looking at the log</h2>
  In general, you won't be looking at the log, at least not in its raw form. 
But just so you have an idea of what's happening, let's look at the log we 
recorded. You should find it in <tt>sls/<i>date</i>/000/sls-<i>date</i>-000-hublog.txt</tt>,
 since it's the first log you've recorded in this directory on this data.
 
<blockquote><tt>LOGFILE_FORMAT_VERSION: 1.0</tt>    
  <p><tt>LOG_VERSION: Parser, version 1</tt> </p>
   
  <p><tt>SESSION_ID: Default</tt> <br>
 &nbsp; <br>
 &nbsp; <br>
 &nbsp; </p>
   
  <p><tt>:BEGIN_UTT (-01)</tt> <br>
   <tt>[Timestamp (-01): read:GAL_MESSAGE_MSG_TYPE UI(&lt;remote&gt;:-1)
1 UserInput at 10:17:14.58 on 27-SEP-2001]</tt> <br>
   <tt>[Timestamp (-01): send:GAL_MESSAGE_MSG_TYPE Parser(localhost:10000)
 1 Parse at 10:17:14.59 on 27-SEP-2001]</tt> <br>
   <tt>:input_string (-01): "I WANT TO FLY FROM BOSTON TO LOS ANGELES"</tt>
   <br>
   <tt>[Timestamp (-01): read:GAL_REPLY_MSG_TYPE Parser(localhost:10000)
1 Parse at 10:17:14.59 on 27-SEP-2001]</tt> <br>
   <tt>[Begin :frame (-01)]</tt> <br>
   <tt>{c flight</tt> <br>
   <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; :destination "LOS ANGELES"</tt> <br>
   <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; :origin "BOSTON" }</tt> <br>
   <tt>[End :frame (-01)]</tt> <br>
   <tt>[Timestamp (-01): send:GAL_REPLY_MSG_TYPE UI(&lt;remote&gt;:-1) 1
UserInput at 10:17:14.59 on 27-SEP-2001]</tt></p>
 </blockquote>
  You can see that both the read and send (new message and reply) for <tt>UserInput</tt>
 were timestamped, along with the send and read (new message and reply) for 
the <tt>Parse</tt> message. In both cases, the server's name and location 
were also recorded, as well as the token index (in this case, 1). You can 
also see that the <tt>:input_string</tt> key-value pair was logged, as was 
the <tt>:frame</tt> key-value pair.  
<p>As for administrative information, you can see that the log contains the 
version we provided in the logfile, as well as a format version number (in 
case the format changes), and an indication of the current session (again, 
more on this later; for this reason, also ignore <tt>:BEGIN_UTT</tt> and the
-01 that appear in the log). </p>
 
<p>We provide a set of tools to postprocess these logs in a number of ways. 
To illustrate this, we're going to use the "real" toy travel demo. </p>
 
<p> </p>
 
<hr width="100%">  
<h2> <a name="The_real_toy_travel_demo"></a>The "real" toy travel demo</h2>
  The version of the toy travel demo <a
 href="../../../contrib/MITRE/demos/docs/toy-travel-tut.html">we used</a> 
differs from the default version in the distribution in four ways:  
<ul>
  <li> It uses a shorter interaction script</li>
   <li> It inserts breakpoints, which we used to pause the Hub</li>
   <li> It allows only the Audio dummy server to connect, and not the UI
dummy server</li>
   <li> It doesn't do logging</li>
   
</ul>
  Now, we're going to address the last of these points. So let's run the
"real" toy travel demo. To prepare for this, please delete the <tt>sls</tt>
directory which contains the simple log we just generated:  
<blockquote><b><tt>[Logging exercise 2]<br>
   <br>
 Unix csh/tcsh:<br>
   </tt></b>    
  <p><tt>% rm -rf sls</tt> <br>
   <tt>% setenv TTDEMO $GC_HOME/contrib/MITRE/demos/toy-travel</tt> <br>
   <tt>% process_monitor $TTDEMO/toy-travel.config -- $TTDEMO/example.frames
 $TTDEMO/toy-travel.pgm<br>
  </tt></p>
  <p><b><tt> Unix csh/tcsh:<br>
   </tt></b>    </p>
  <p><tt>% rm -rf sls</tt> <br>
   <tt>% TTDEMO=$GC_HOME/contrib/MITRE/demos/toy-travel; export TTDEMO</tt><br>
   <tt>% process_monitor $TTDEMO/toy-travel.config -- $TTDEMO/example.frames
 $TTDEMO/toy-travel.pgm</tt></p>
   
  <p><tt><b>Windows:</b><br>
   </tt></p>
   
  <p><tt>C:\&gt; rmdir /S sls<br>
 C:\&gt; set TTDEMO=%GC_HOME%\contrib\MITRE\demos\toy-travel<br>
 C:\&gt; python %PM_DIR%\process_monitor.py %TTDEMO%\toy-travel.config -- 
%TTDEMO%\example.frames %TTDEMO%\toy-travel.pgm<br>
   </tt></p>
 </blockquote>
  Select "Process Control --&gt; Restart all". This will start all the servers, 
then the Hub, and finally two additional process monitors, one for the Audio 
server and one for the UI server. In the "Audio client" process monitor, press
"Start". Each time you see the prompt <tt>"Hit &lt;return&gt; to send speech:"</tt>
in the scrollable output history, press the "Input &lt;return&gt;" button,
until the server exits. In the toy travel process monitor, press the "IOMonitor"
button. You should see something like the following in the scrollable output
history:  
<blockquote><b><tt>[Toy travel scrollable output history]</tt></b>    
  <p><tt>[exec $DEMO_ROOT/bin/IOMonitor -verbosity 0 2&gt;&amp;1]</tt> <br>
   <tt>In session session-1001366584.434: system said "Welcome to Communicator.
 How may I help you?"</tt> <br>
   <tt>In session session-1001366584.434: user said "I WANT TO FLY LOS ANGELES"</tt>
   <br>
   <tt>In session session-1001366584.434: system said "Where are you traveling
 from?"</tt> <br>
   <tt>In session session-1001366584.434: user said "BOSTON"</tt> <br>
   <tt>In session session-1001366584.434: system said "American Airlines
flight 115 leaves at 11:44 AM, and United flight 436 leaves at 2:05 PM"</tt></p>
 </blockquote>
  Select "File --&gt; Quit" in the toy travel process monitor to end the
interaction.  
<p> </p>
 
<hr width="100%">  
<h2> <a name="Working_with_logs"></a>Working with logs</h2>
  In the DARPA Communicator project, we've established a scoring procedure 
which reports a range of metrics based on these log files. MITRE has developed 
a set of tools (which NIST is now maintaining, but we continue to distribute) 
to help generate these metrics. For details on these tools and metrics, see 
the <a href="../../../contrib/MITRE/tools/docs/log_tools.html">log tools reference</a>.
in the remainder of this exercise, we will describe this procedure and give
you an illustration.  
<p>Most of the steps in this procedure are automated. The tools convert the 
raw Hub log into XML, and then use a hand-generated rules file to add significant 
"landmarks" to the log (e.g., the <tt>:input_string</tt> value in the <tt>Parse</tt> 
message corresponds to the output of the recognizer). These tools add both 
these annotations and a set of hand annotations (such as audio transcriptions)
 to the log, and the result can be used for summarization, validation or
scoring:  </p>
 
<p><img src="../../images/LogTools.jpg" nosave="" height="407"
 width="743">
  </p>
 
<p>Let's examine a summary for the interaction you just performed. We've provided
a set of rules to add the landmarks, but no hand annotations, so the summary
will show the "recognizer output" but not the audio "transcription". We'll
summarize the entire contents of the <tt>sls</tt> subdirectory, since  all
the tools work recursively: </p>
 
<blockquote><b><tt>[Logging exercise 3]<br>
   <br>
 Unix:<br>
   </tt></b>    
  <p><tt>% process_monitor $GC_HOME/tutorial/logging/show-log.config<br>
   </tt></p>
   
  <p><tt><b>Windows:</b><br>
   </tt></p>
   
  <p><tt>C:\&gt; </tt><tt>python %PM_DIR%\process_monitor.py %GC_HOME%\tutorial\logging\show-log.config</tt><br>
   </p>
 </blockquote>
  Press "Start", and review the output. You'll see the summary of the interpreted 
log: when the user and system started and stopped speaking, what each of them
said, and when user and system turns began and ended. When you're done examining
the summary, select "File --&gt; Quit".  
<p> </p>
 
<hr width="100%">  
<h2> <a name="Summary"></a>Summary</h2>
  In this lesson, we've explored the basics of configuring the program file 
to generate a raw Hub log, and what we can do with that log. In the next lesson,
we'll talk about how sessions help you manage your interactions, and in the
final lesson, we'll cover all the random odds and ends which you need to
understand to finally assemble an end-to-end system.
