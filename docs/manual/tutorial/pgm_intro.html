<p>In our hub-and-spoke configuration, we've seen that it's the Hub which
 maintains connections to all the servers and routes the message traffic.
We've already learned a great deal about how Hub program files work, even
though we haven't looked yet at the technical details. In this lesson, we'll
learn the basics of how program files are constructed. We'll learn about
other Hub program functionality in future lessons. </p>

 about Hub program file syntax</h2>
   A line in a Hub program file can be   
<ul>
   <li> a <b>directive entry</b>, which consists of a <b>directive</b> (like
 PROGRAM: or RULE:) and its value;</li>
    <li> a comment, which is indicated by a semicolon (;) in column 0; or</li>
    <li> a blank line, which has no meaning except to terminate certain directive
 entry blocks like RULE:.</li>
     
</ul>
   If the final character of a physical line in a directive entry is a backslash
 (\), the line break is ignored and the next line is treated as part of the
 same directive entry.   
<p>There are three types of information in the program file: </p>
   
<ul>
   <li> global information</li>
    <li> server declarations</li>
    <li> programs</li>
     
</ul>
   <img src="../../images/ProgramFile.jpg" nosave="" height="335"
 width="695">
     
<p>There are lots of directives, and each directive expects a value of a
certain type or format. We're only going to look at a few of the directives
and values. You can consult the <a href="../reference/pgm.html">complete
documentation</a>  if you want to know more. </p>

<h2> <a name="Global_information_and_server_declarations"></a>Global information
 and server declarations</h2>
   As a first example, we'll begin with the program file we used in the <a
 href="../../../contrib/MITRE/tools/docs/unit_tester_tut.html#Starting_the_unit_tester_as_a_server">second 
 unit tester exercise</a>. In that exercise, you'll recall, there were two 
 servers: the Parser server from the toy travel demo, and the unit tester, 
 acting as a server. The Hub contacted the Parser server, while the unit tester
contacted the Hub. We discussed this process in our lesson on <a
 href="how_it_works.html#Hub_and_servers_contact_each_other">how  the Hub
and servers communicate</a>. Here's the relevant fragment of the program
file <tt>parse.pgm</tt>:   
<blockquote><b><tt>[parse.pgm]</tt></b>       
  <p><tt><b>&nbsp;1:</b>;; Use extended syntax (new in version 3.0).</tt> 
   <br>
    <b><tt>&nbsp;2:</tt></b> <br>
    <tt><b>&nbsp;3:</b>PGM_SYNTAX: extended</tt> <br>
    <b><tt>&nbsp;4:</tt></b> <br>
    <tt><b>&nbsp;5:</b>SERVICE_TYPE: UI</tt> <br>
    <tt><b>&nbsp;6:</b>CLIENT_PORT: 14500</tt> <br>
    <b><tt>&nbsp;7:</tt></b> <br>
    <tt><b>&nbsp;8:</b>SERVER: Parser</tt> <br>
    <tt><b>&nbsp;8:</b>HOST: localhost</tt> <br>
    <tt><b>10:</b>PORT: 10000</tt> <br>
    <tt><b>11:</b>OPERATIONS: Parse</tt></p>
  </blockquote>
   Let's look first at the syntax of this fragment.   
<ul>
   <li> Line 1 starts with a semicolon, and so it is a comment.</li>
    <li> Line 2 is blank. It is ignored, because there's no block to terminate.</li>
    <li> Line 3 is a directive entry. The directive is PGM_SYNTAX:, and the
 value is "extended".</li>
    <li> Line 4 is blank. It is ignored, because there's no block to terminate.</li>
    <li> Lines 5-6 are a directive entry block. The first directive, SERVICE_TYPE:,
 determines what type of block it is.</li>
    <li> Line 7 is blank. It terminates the directive entry block.</li>
    <li> Lines 8-11 are a directive entry block. The first directive, SERVER:
 determines what type of block it is.</li>
     
</ul>
   Now that we know what we're looking at, let's take a closer look at the
 directive entries.   
<h3> <a name="PGM_SYNTAX:"></a>PGM_SYNTAX:</h3>
   In version 3.0 of the Galaxy Communicator infrastructure, we extended
the  syntax of the Hub program file and made it more consistent overall.
However,  since these modifications were not backward compatible, we chose
to enable  them through an explicit directive entry. <b>Always begin your
program file  with this entry</b>.   
<h3> <a name="Atomic_string_values"></a>Atomic string values</h3>
   The value of the PGM_SYNTAX: directive, as well as a number of the other
 directives we'll discuss here, is a string. Typically, values for directives
 have the same printed form as <a
 href="frame_intro.html#What's_in_a_frame">they do in frames</a>.  So we'd
expect line 3 to look like this:   
<blockquote><tt>PGM_SYNTAX: "extended"</tt></blockquote>
   However, for readability purposes, the Hub program file parser also recognizes
 these values (and sequences of these values) without their delimiting quotation
 marks. This is the last interpretation considered; so, for instance, a directive
 value which is a number will be interpreted as such, rather than a string
 consisting entirely of digit characters.   
<h3> <a name="Service_types_and_service_providers"></a>Service types and
service providers</h3>
   You may recall from our lesson on the <a
 href="../../../contrib/MITRE/demos/docs/toy-travel-tut.html#Understanding_what_you_see:_Hub_startup">toy 
 travel demo</a> that the Hub distinguishes between <b>service types</b> and
<b>service providers</b>. The idea is that the Hub might want or need access
to multiple servers of the same conceptual type: multiple recognizers for
load balancing, multiple audio servers for multiple simultaneous users. The
conceptual type corresponds to the service type. Service types have a name
and a set of operations; the actual servers which implement these operations
 are the service providers.   
<p>Each of these is defined by a separate block, terminated by a blank line
 (or the first directive entry of another block of the same type). The two
 directive entry blocks in this Hub program file fragment illustrate two
dimensions  of this distinction. </p>
   
<h3> <a name="SERVICE_TYPE:"></a>SERVICE_TYPE:</h3>
   Each service type has a name, which is the value of the SERVICE_TYPE:
directive.  A block which begins with the SERVICE_TYPE: directive may also
contain an  OPERATIONS: directive and a CLIENT_PORT: directive, <a
 href="../reference/pgm.html#Service_types">among others</a>. The value  of
this directive is a string.   
<h3> <a name="CLIENT_PORT:"></a>CLIENT_PORT:</h3>
   A service type may set up a listener to await connections from providers
 for this service type. The CLIENT_PORT: directive is a number which specifies
 the port to set up the listener on. So in this fragment, the UI service
type  will set up a listener on port 14500.   
<h3> <a name="OPERATIONS:"></a>OPERATIONS:</h3>
   Each service type may declare a set of operations, which are dispatch
functions  it expects the providers to implement. The Hub will choose a service
provider  to use in a rule only if the Hub program file has declared that
the corresponding  service type supports the operation, via the OPERATIONS:
directive. The value  of this directive is a sequence of strings. In this
fragment, the UI service  type declares no operations (so the only messages
it will receive from the  Hub are replies to messages it sends).   
<h3> <a name="SERVICE_PROVIDER:"></a>SERVICE_PROVIDER:</h3>
   Each service provider block corresponds to a service provider the Hub
will  contact. The provider implements a service type (sometimes more than
one);  the value of the SERVICE_PROVIDER: directive is the name of the service
type(s)  it implements. This block may also contain a HOST: directive, a
PORT: directive,  and a LOCATION: directive, <a
 href="../reference/pgm.html#Service_providers">among others</a>.   
<p>Since each service type defines a set of supported operations, all providers
 for a given service type must support the same operations (i.e., define
the  appropriately named dispatch function). So in the following example,
both  providers must define the <tt>Parse</tt> dispatch function: </p>
   
<blockquote><tt>SERVICE_TYPE:&nbsp;Parser</tt> <br>
    <tt>OPERATIONS:&nbsp;Parse</tt><tt></tt>       
  <p><tt>SERVICE_PROVIDER:&nbsp;Parser</tt> <br>
    <tt>HOST: localhost</tt> <br>
    <tt>PORT:&nbsp;15000</tt><tt></tt> </p>
       
  <p><tt>SERVICE_PROVIDER:&nbsp;Parser</tt> <br>
    <tt>HOST:&nbsp;localhost</tt> <br>
    <tt>PORT:&nbsp;16007</tt></p>
  </blockquote>
   Multiple service types can define the same operation. So, for instance,
 you might choose to distinguish between parsers for French and parsers for
 Chinese by classifying them as different service types (there are better
ways to do this, but let's assume it for the moment). They can both define
the <tt>Parse</tt> operation, and any providers for these types must support
that operation:   
<blockquote><tt>SERVICE_TYPE:&nbsp;ChineseParser</tt> <br>
    <tt>OPERATIONS:&nbsp;Parse</tt><tt></tt>       
  <p><tt>SERVICE_TYPE:&nbsp;FrenchParser</tt> <br>
    <tt>OPERATIONS:&nbsp;Parse</tt></p>
  </blockquote>
      
<h3> <a name="SERVER:"></a>SERVER:</h3>
   The SERVER: block is almost identical to the SERVICE_TYPE: block, except
 it may also contain the locations of various service providers for that
type.  In other words, lines 8-11 of this fragment are equivalent to   
<blockquote><tt>SERVICE_TYPE: Parser</tt> <br>
    <tt>OPERATIONS: Parse</tt>       
  <p><tt>SERVICE_PROVIDER: Parser</tt> <br>
    <tt>HOST: localhost</tt> <br>
    <tt>PORT: 10000</tt></p>
  </blockquote>
      
<h3> <a name="HOST:"></a>HOST:</h3>
   Each service provider needs to specify the location of the listener that
 the Hub will contact. The value of the HOST: directive is a string naming
 the machine where the service provider's listener is.   
<h3> <a name="PORT:"></a>PORT:</h3>
   The value of the PORT: directive is an integer corresponding to the port
 number that the service provider's listener is listening on. So in this
fragment,  the Hub expects to find a service provider for the Parser service
type listening  on port 10000 on the local host.   
<h3> <a name="LOCATION:"></a>LOCATION:</h3>
   A shorthand for specifying HOST: and PORT: simultaneously. The value of
 this directive is a string <tt>&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;</tt>.   
<p>So this fragment declares two service types, UI and Parser. It tells the
 Hub to set up a listener for the UI service type, and to contact a service
 provider for the Parser service type at the local host, port 10000. Here's
 an illustration: </p>

<h2> <a name="Hub_program_directives"></a>Hub program directives</h2>
   For a quick introduction to programs in Hub program files, let's consider
 the program in <tt>parse.pgm</tt>:   
<blockquote><tt>PROGRAM: UserInput</tt>       
  <p><tt>RULE: :input_string --&gt; Parser.Parse</tt> <br>
    <tt>IN: :input_string</tt> <br>
    <tt>OUT: :frame</tt></p>
  </blockquote>
   In many ways, this is about a simple as programs ever get. It corresponds
 approximately to a small subsection of the toy travel demo.   
<center>   
<p><img src="../../images/ParsePgm.jpg" nosave="" height="455"
 width="623">
  </p>
  </center>
      
<h3> <a name="PROGRAM:"></a>PROGRAM:</h3>
   You should remember from the basics lesson that <a
 href="how_it_works.html#When_the_Hub_receives_a_new_message">when  the Hub
receives a new message</a>, it tries to match the name of the incoming  frame
with the name of a Hub program. This directive entry begins a Hub program,
and the value of the directive is a string which is the name of the program.
Programs are terminated by the end of the Hub program file or by another
PROGRAM: directive entry.   
<h3> <a name="RULE:"></a>RULE:</h3>
   Each Hub program is a sequence of rules. Each rule is a directive entry
 block terminated by a blank line. The RULE: directive entry indicates the
 beginning of a rule. This block may also contain IN: and OUT: directive
entries,  <a href="../reference/pgm.html#Rules">among others</a>. The value
of the RULE: directive is fairly complicated; it consists of a (possibly
empty) set of conditions, an implication arrow (<tt>--&gt;</tt>), and an
operation name, which can be specified either as <tt>&lt;operation&gt;</tt>
or <tt>&lt;service_type&gt;.&lt;operation&gt;</tt>.  <br>
  <img src="../../images/ProgramFileRule.jpg" nosave="" height="215"
 width="623">
   <br>
  The set of conditions is evaluated against the state of the <a
 href="how_it_works.html#When_the_Hub_receives_a_new_message:_tokens_and_rules">current 
 token</a>. The condition here is a simple atomic condition requiring the 
presence of the <tt>:input_string</tt> key (with any value) in the frame comprising
the token state. If this condition is satisfied, the Hub fires the rule,
which means that the Hub finds a service provider for a service type which
implements the named operation (in this case, <tt>Parse</tt>) and sends the
provider an appropriate message. If the service type is specified in the
operation name (in this case, <tt>Parser</tt>), only providers for the named
service type will be considered.   
<h3> <a name="IN:"></a>IN:</h3>
   When the Hub decides to fire a rule, it must construct a message to send.
 The name of the message will be the name of the operation (in this case,
<tt>Parser.Parse</tt>). The value of the IN: directive describes how to construct
the message given the current token. In this example, the instruction <tt>:input_string</tt> 
 means that the Hub will look for a key-value pair in the token whose key 
is <tt>:input_string</tt>, and, if present, copy it into the message.   
<h3> <a name="OUT:"></a>OUT:</h3>
   When the server has finished executing the operation, it typically returns
 the result to the Hub. The value of the OUT: directive describes how to
update  the current token given the message return. In this example, the
<tt>:frame</tt>  instruction means that the Hub will look for a key-value
pair in the message  return whose key is <tt>:frame</tt>, and, if present,
copy it into the current  token.   
<h3> <a name="Summary_(rule)"></a>Summary</h3>
   Here's an illustration of the overall process: <br>
  <img src="../../images/TokenUpdate.jpg" nosave="" height="479"

<hr width="100%">   
<h2> <a name="Rules_and_namespaces"></a>Rules and namespaces</h2>
   In order to understand the possible complexity of rules (and other program
 file directives that we won't be discussing here), it's important to understand
 the notion of <b>namespace</b>. We've seen that the Hub uses frames to maintain
 at least two distinct types of information states: tokens and messages.
These  types are interrelated:   
<ul>
   <li> incoming messages constitute the initial state of tokens</li>
    <li> the token state is used to construct new messages to be sent to
servers  (the IN: directive)</li>
    <li> the token state is updated based on message returns from servers 
(the OUT: directive)</li>
     
</ul>
   We'll refer to these types of information states as <b>namespaces</b>. 
In addition to the message and token namespaces, there are two others which
 we'll encounter:   
<ul>
   <li> the <b>session</b> namespace, which is the set of key-value pairs 
specific to the current user's dialogue with the system (more on this later)</li>
    <li> the <b>global</b> namespace, which is a globally-accessible set
of  key-value pairs</li>
     
</ul>
   For more on namespaces, see the <a
 href="../reference/pgm.html#Key-value_pairs">program file reference</a>. 
  
<p>Each directive in a rule directive entry block has a namespace or namespaces
 associated with it. The RULE: directive is associated with the token namespace,
 for instance. The IN: and OUT: directives have both a source namespace (the
 memory state from which the pairs are drawn) and a target namespace (the
memory state which is updated). The IN: directive's source namespace is the
token namespace (that is, that's where the values come from), and its target
namespace is the message namespace (that is, that's where the values go).
For OUT:, it's the other way around. </p>
   
<p>For this discussion, let's assume a situation where our new <tt>UserInput</tt>
 message arrives at the Hub in a context where the global namespace contains
 the key-value pair <tt>:fragments_permitted 1</tt> and the session namespace
 contains the key-value pair <tt>:language "English"</tt>: </p>
   
<center>   
<p><img src="../../images/Namespace1.jpg" nosave="" height="431"
 width="551">
  </p>
  </center>
      
<h3> <a name="Specifying_the_namespace_explicitly"></a>Specifying the namespace
 explicitly</h3>
   It's possible to specify a namespace explicitly, using an operator named
 <tt>$in</tt>. You can use this operator to override the namespace defaults
 associated with a directive. So, for instance, the following two RULE: directive
 entries are equivalent, since the default namespace associated with the
RULE:  directive is the token namespace:   
<blockquote><tt>RULE: :input_string --&gt; Parser.Parse</tt>       
  <p><tt>RULE: $in(:input_string token) --&gt; Parser.Parse</tt></p>
  </blockquote>
   If we want to fire a rule only if the global namespace contains a key-value
 pair whose key is <tt>:fragments_permitted</tt>, as in our example, we can
 write this rule as follows:   
<blockquote><tt>RULE: $in(:fragments_permitted global) --&gt; Parser.Parse</tt></blockquote>
   So essentially, a frame key in a directive is a shorthand for a reference
 to that key in the default namespace.   
<h3> <a name="Distinguishing_between_source_and_target_namespaces"></a>Distinguishing 
 between source and target namespaces</h3>
   For those directives like IN: and OUT: which have both source and target
 namespaces, it's possible to distinguish between the source and target using
 a list of length two, where the first element is the target and the second
 element is the source. So the following two directives are equivalent: 
 
<blockquote><tt>IN: :input_string</tt> <br>
    <tt>IN: (:input_string :input_string)</tt></blockquote>
   In both cases, the directive looks for a key-value pair with the key <tt>:input_string</tt> 
 in the source namespace and inserts the value in the target namespace under 
 the key :<tt>input_string</tt>.   
<p>As you may have guessed at this point, you can use this syntax to refer
 to different keys in the source and target. So let's suppose that the Parse
 dispatch function expects the key <tt>:string</tt>, rather than <tt>:input_string</tt>, 
 and returns the result in a key <tt>:parse,</tt> rather than <tt>:frame</tt>.
 If we wish to preserve the token state shown <a
 href="#Summary_(rule)">previously</a>, we could rewrite our rule as
 follows: </p>
   
<blockquote><tt>RULE: :input_string --&gt; Parser.Parse</tt> <br>
    <tt>IN: (:string :input_string)</tt> <br>
    <tt>OUT: (:frame :parse)</tt></blockquote>
   The value of <tt>:input_string</tt> in the source namespace for IN: (namely,
 the token) will be copied to <tt>:string</tt> in the target namespace (namely,
 the message), and the value of <tt>:parse</tt> in the source namespace for
 OUT: (namely, the message return) will be copied to <tt>:frame</tt> in the
 target namespace (namely, the token). Here's an illustration:   
<center>   
<p><img src="../../images/Namespace2.jpg" nosave="" height="407"
 width="623">
  </p>
  </center>
      
<h3> <a name="Using_$in_for_source_and_target"></a>Using <tt>$in</tt> for
 source and target</h3>
   Unsurprisingly, you can put these two things together, by overriding either
 the source or the target in the mapping list. Let's say we want to copy
the  value of the <tt>:language</tt> key in the session namespace to the
<tt>:lang</tt>  key in the message. The IN: directive entry would look like
this:   
<blockquote><tt>IN: (:lang $in(:language session))</tt></blockquote>
   If the <tt>$in</tt> operator isn't part of a pair in IN: or OUT:, it's 
treated as the source key and namespace. The key is also used as the key for
the target namespace, and the target namespace is the default. So the following
directive entries are equivalent:   
<blockquote><tt>IN $in(:language session)</tt> <br>
    <tt>IN: (:language $in(:language session))</tt> <br>
    <tt>IN: ($in(:language message) $in(:language session))</tt></blockquote>
      
<h3> <a name="Literal_values"></a>Literal values</h3>
   The pair notation for IN: and OUT: can also be used to specify literal 
values. These literal values appear in the source position. If, for example, 
we want to insert a literal confidence threshold in the message sent to the 
parser, we can do it as follows:   
<blockquote><tt>IN: (:threshold .8)</tt></blockquote>
   These literal values can be any frame key value, just like the <a
 href="#Atomic_string_values">values of directives</a>, and the keys can be
explicit namespace references.

<h2> <a name="Rule_conditions"></a>Rule conditions</h2>
   So far, the only rule condition we've encountered is an existence condition,
 i.e., whether or not there's a key-value pair for the given key in the appropriate
 namespace:   
<blockquote><tt>RULE: :input_string --&gt; Parser.Parse</tt></blockquote>
   The existence condition can be negated:   
<blockquote><tt>RULE: !:parse_completed --&gt; Parser.Parse</tt></blockquote>
   The basic conditions also include numeric comparisons (<tt>&gt;, &lt;, 
=</tt>) and string equality (<tt>=</tt>) and their negations:   
<blockquote><tt>RULE: :threshold &gt; .8 --&gt; Parser.Parse</tt> <br>
    <tt>RULE: :input_string != "ignore" --&gt; Parser.Parse</tt></blockquote>
   These conditions can be recursively combined using conjunction (<tt>&amp;</tt>) 
 and disjunction (|):   
<blockquote><tt>RULE: :input_string &amp; (:threshold &gt; .8) --&gt; Parser.Parse</tt> 
   <br>
    <tt>RULE: (:threshold &gt; .8) | (:input_string != "ignore") --&gt; Parser.Parse</tt></blockquote>
   The <a href="../reference/pgm.html#Rule_conditions">program file reference</a>
 discusses rule conditions in considerably more detail.   
<p>Let's do a simple example to illustrate what happens when conditions don't
 match. Remember our simple program: </p>
   
<blockquote><tt>PROGRAM: UserInput</tt>       
  <p><tt>RULE: :input_string --&gt; Parser.Parse</tt> <br>
    <tt>IN: :input_string</tt> <br>
    <tt>OUT: :frame</tt></p>
  </blockquote>
   Now let's send a message that doesn't match.   
<blockquote><tt><b>[Hub program exercise 1]</b><br>
  <br>
  <b>Unix:</b><br>
  </tt>       
  <p><tt>% process_monitor $GC_HOME/tutorial/program_file/nomatch.config<br>
  </tt></p>
  <p><tt><b>Windows:</b><br>
  </tt></p>
  <p><tt>c:\&gt; python %PM_DIR%\process_monitor.py %GC_HOME%\tutorial\program_file\nomatch.config</tt><br>
  </p>
  </blockquote>
   Start the Parser, then the Hub, then finally the unit tester. (When you
 start the unit tester server, you won't be asked for a reply for the <tt>reinitialize</tt> 
 message, as you were in the <a
 href="../../../contrib/MITRE/tools/docs/unit_tester_tut.html#Starting_the_unit_tester_as_a_server">unit 
 tester tutorial</a>. This is because the unit tester is being started with 
 the <tt>--ignore_reinitialize</tt> flag. See the <a
 href="../../../contrib/MITRE/tools/docs/unit_tester_ref.html">unit tester
 reference</a> for more details.) Select "Send new message", select the frame
 named <tt>UserInput</tt>, press "Reply Required" and then OK. You'll see
the following in the Hub pane:   
<blockquote><b><tt>[Hub pane]</tt></b>       
  <p><tt>---------------- [ 1] ----------------------</tt> <br>
    <tt>{c UserInput</tt> <br>
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; :string "I WANT TO FLY FROM BOSTON TO LOS ANGELES"</tt> 
   <br>
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; :session_id "Default"</tt> <br>
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; :tidx 1 }</tt> <br>
    <tt>--------------------------------------------</tt> </p>
       
  <p><tt>Done with token 1 --&gt; returning to owner UI@&lt;remote&gt;:-1<br>
  Destroying token 1 <br>
    </tt></p>
  </blockquote>
   And the unit tester interaction history will show that the result is almost
 identical to what was sent:   
<blockquote><b><tt>[Interaction History pane]</tt></b>       
  <p><tt>[Sending: new message]</tt> <br>
    <tt>{c UserInput</tt> <br>
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; :string "I WANT TO FLY FROM BOSTON TO LOS ANGELES" }</tt> 
   <br>
    <tt>[Received: reply message]</tt> <br>
    <tt>{c UserInput</tt> <br>
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; :string "I WANT TO FLY FROM BOSTON TO LOS ANGELES"</tt> 
   <br>
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; :session_id "Default" }</tt></p>
  </blockquote>
   It should be clear what has happened. The <tt>UserInput</tt> program has
 a single rule, which fires if the token contains the <tt>:input_string</tt> 
 key. The message we sent contains the <tt>:string</tt> key, but not the <tt>:input_string</tt>
 key, and so the token which is instantiated from the new message doesn't
contain the <tt>:input_string</tt> key. As a result, the rule in the program
doesn't fire, which means that the Parser server isn't invoked, and there
are no updates to the token state. When the program ends (trivially, since
it didn't fire the only rule), it returns the token state to the unit tester,
since it asked for a reply.   
<p>Select "File --&gt; Quit" to end this exercise. </p>

<h2> <a name="Managing_flow_of_control"></a>Managing flow of control</h2>
   Typically, the Hub evaluates a Hub program by considering each rule in 
turn. When a rule condition is satisfied, the Hub fires the rule and waits 
for the response from the server. When the Hub receives the response, it resumes
the process at the rule immediately after the rule it fired, until it reaches
the end of the program.   
<p>However, it's possible both to ignore the response from the server and
 to terminate the program before the final rule is considered. The simplest
 way to do this is through two special values of the OUT: directive, <tt>none!</tt> 
 and <tt>destroy!</tt>. </p>
   
<h3> <a name="The_none!_value"></a>The <tt>none! </tt>value</h3>
   If the value of OUT: is <tt>none!</tt>, then the Hub will not wait for 
the server to respond, and will immediately move on to consider the next rule.
If the server does respond, the response will be ignored. In essence, then,
this rule and any subsequent rules which match will be fired simultaneously.
 We've already seen an example of this behavior.   
<p>You may recall from the <a
 href="../../../contrib/MITRE/demos/docs/toy-travel-tut.html">toy travel
demo</a> that the input string was printed out by the IOMonitor server immediately
 before it was passed to the Parser server. The corresponding program file
 fragment looks like this: </p>
   
<blockquote><tt>PROGRAM: UserInput</tt>       
  <p><tt>RULE: :input_string --&gt; IOMonitor.ReportIO</tt> <br>
    <tt>IN: (:utterance :input_string) (:who "user")</tt> <br>
    <tt>OUT: none!</tt> </p>
       
  <p><tt>RULE: :input_string --&gt; Parser.Parse</tt> <br>
    <tt>IN: :input_string</tt> <br>
    <tt>OUT: :frame</tt></p>
  </blockquote>
   By now, we can read the IN: directive entry for the first rule. The value
 for the <tt>:input_string</tt> key in the source (token) namespace is copied
 to the <tt>:utterance</tt> key in the target (message) namespace, and the
 <tt>:who</tt> key in the target namespace is given the literal string value
 <tt>"user"</tt>. The value OUT: directive informs us that the response from
 the server will be ignored. So if the token has an <tt>:input_string</tt> 
 key-value pair, both these rules will be fired at the same time.   
<p>We can see this behavior in action in the following exercise: </p>
   
<blockquote><b><tt>[Hub program exercise 2]<br>
  <br>
Unix:<br>
  </tt></b>       
  <p><tt>% process_monitor $GC_HOME/tutorial/program_file/none.config<br>
  </tt></p>
  <p><tt><b>Windows:</b><br>
  </tt></p>
  <p><tt>C:\&gt; python %PM_DIR%\process_monitor.py %GC_HOME%\tutorial\program_file\none.config</tt><br>
   </p>
     </blockquote>
   You'll see a process monitor with four panes. Start the Parser, IOMonitor,
 Hub and finally the unit tester server. Select "Send new message", and select
 the frame named <tt>UserInput</tt>, as before. Press "Reply required", and
 then OK.   
<p>Now take a look at the Hub pane. You should see something like this: </p>
   
<blockquote><b><tt>[Hub pane]</tt></b>       
  <p><tt>----------------[&nbsp; 1]----------------------<br>
  {c UserInput<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; :input_string "I WANT TO FLY FROM BOSTON TO LOS ANGELES"<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; :session_id "Default"<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; :tidx 1 }<br>
  --------------------------------------------<br>
    <br>
  Found operation for token 1: IOMonitor.ReportIO<br>
  Found operation for token 1: Parser.Parse<br>
  Serving message with token index 1 to provider for IOMonitor @ localhost:10050<br>
  ---- Serve(IOMonitor@localhost:10050, token 1 op_name ReportIO)<br>
  Serving message with token index 1 to provider for Parser @ localhost:10000<br>
  ---- Serve(Parser@localhost:10000, token 1 op_name Parse)<br>
  Got reply from provider for Parser @ localhost:10000 : token 1<br>
    <br>
  ----------------[&nbsp; 1]----------------------<br>
  {c UserInput<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; :input_string "I WANT TO FLY FROM BOSTON TO LOS ANGELES"<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; :session_id "Default"<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; :tidx 1<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; :frame {c flight ... } }<br>
  --------------------------------------------<br>
    <br>
  Done with token 1 --&gt; returning to owner UI@&lt;remote&gt;:-1<br>
  Destroying token 1</tt></p>
  </blockquote>
   You can see that the two operations in the program matched essentially 
at the same time, and were sent to their respective servers at essentially 
the same time. The Parser server provided a response, and the token state 
is updated as before.   
<p>Select "File --&gt; Quit" to end this exercise. </p>
   
<h3> <a name="The_destroy!_value"></a>The <tt>destroy! </tt>value</h3>
   The <tt>destroy!</tt> value also tells the Hub to ignore the response
from  the server, but it also tells the Hub to terminate executing the program.
 For instance, we might want to notify the IOMonitor and abort the execution
 of the <tt>UserInput</tt> program if the <tt>:input_string</tt> key was
not  present:   
<blockquote><tt>PROGRAM: UserInput</tt>       
  <p><tt>RULE: !:input_string --&gt; IOMonitor.ReportIO</tt> <br>
    <tt>IN: (:utterance "&lt;no input string found&gt;") (:who "user")</tt> 
   <br>
    <tt>OUT: destroy!</tt> </p>
       
  <p><tt>RULE: :input_string --&gt; IOMonitor.ReportIO</tt> <br>
    <tt>IN: (:utterance :input_string) (:who "user")</tt> <br>
    <tt>OUT: none!</tt> </p>
       
  <p><tt>RULE: :input_string --&gt; Parser.Parse</tt> <br>
    <tt>IN: :input_string</tt> <br>
    <tt>OUT: :frame</tt></p>
  </blockquote>
   If there's no operation you want to fire, there are other ways of destroying
 the token; we'll talk about these when we talk about the Builtin server
and  building end-to-end systems.

   Now that we understand the basics of writing both servers and Hub program
 files, we can move on to study functionality which involves both additional
 server capabilities and corresponding functionality in the Hub program file.
