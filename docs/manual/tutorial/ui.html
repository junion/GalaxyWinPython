<p>Up to this point, we haven't talked much about the engineering model behind
the Galaxy Communicator infrastructure, and we haven't needed to. However,
in order to learn how to integrate UI elements into a Communicator-compliant
system, it's important to understand how things happen in the infrastructure,
and how to control how things happen. This lesson is more about computer
science than anything else, and we won't look at any code; but at its end,
you should understand enough about how the Communicator infrastructure works
to integrate a UI aspects into a Communicator-compliant server. </p>

<h2> <a name="The_Communicator_object_model"></a>The Communicator object
model</h2>
 There are several object types involved in flow of control in the Galaxy
Communicator infrastructure. The first Galaxy Communicator object we came
across in looking at server code was the call environment. In the last lesson,
on <a href="broker_tutorial.html">brokering</a>, we encountered the broker
object. We briefly encountered the server object when discussing the <a
 href="basic_server.html#Step_3:_Write_your_server_initialization_function">server 
initialization function</a>. The one object we haven't encountered yet is
the connection object, which underlies both ends of Hub-server connections
and broker connections. (Broker proxies aren't on this list because they're
just object wrappers around brokers.) Here's the complete object model: <br>
<img src="../../images/ObjectModel.jpg" nosave="" height="503"
 width="863">
 <br>
The reason this object model is important is because the server, connection,
and broker objects are all associated with separate communications channels,
and these channels are monitored by the Galaxy Communicator infrastructure
using an <b>event-driven</b> programming model. This model is at the heart
of the flexibility of the Galaxy Communicator infrastructure, and it's worth
spending some time understanding it better. 
<p> </p>
<hr width="100%"> 
<h2> <a name="Event-driven_programming"></a>Event-driven programming</h2>
 There are three major components to an event-driven programming model: 
<ul>
 <li> events;</li>
  <li> callbacks, which are instructions about what to do when an event occurs;</li>
  <li> and an event monitor, which observes the events and invokes the callbacks.</li>
 
</ul>
 In a communications system like Galaxy Communicator, some of the events
are typically the availability of data to read from or write to a communications
channel; we'll call these events <b>data events</b>. Another type of event
is a <b>timer event</b>, which marks the conclusion of a previously-determined
time interval. These events can be used to schedule activities (for example,
inspect the state of a connection every 10 milliseconds). 
<p>For each type of object in the Galaxy Communicator object model, there's
a corresponding callback. The server object can establish a new connection
when it has a request to do so; the connection object can invoke a dispatch
function when it has message data; the outbound broker can feed data to its
connected clients; and the inbound broker can read typed data when it's available. 
</p>
<p>So we can see now that the <a
 href="broker_tutorial.html#Target_server:_set_up_broker_client,_establish_callback">data 
callbacks for the broker clients</a> we learned about in the last lesson are
actually part of this larger model. They're not exactly the low-level data
callbacks we're talking about here, since the data has been read and digested
long before the broker callback sees it; rather, it's one of a set of higher-level
callbacks based on what we'll call <b>logical events</b> that the Galaxy
Communicator infrastructure supports. In general, it's these logical events
which are visible to the average developer, rather than the lower-level data
and timer events. Not surprisingly, dispatch functions also count as a type
of logical callback: </p>
<p><img src="../../images/EventHierarchy.jpg" nosave="" height="335"
 width="695">
 </p>
<p>There are a number of other logical events which the various objects support,
some of which are a direct result of communications events (for instance,
when a server creates a new connection object), and some of which are under
programmer control (for instance, when an outbound or inbound broker is created).
The full set of logical events can be shown as follows: <br>
<img src="../../images/EventModel.jpg" nosave="" height="407"
 width="791">
 </p>
<p>The programmer can associate callbacks with any of these logical events;
in fact, we saw a brief <a
 href="broker_tutorial.html#Target_server:_set_up_broker_client,_establish_callback">example</a> 
of this behavior when our target server associated a data completion callback 
with its broker client. </p>
<p>The power of the event-driven programming model is embodied in its extremely
conservative assumptions about ordering and scheduling. Because events can
occur randomly, the appropriate behavior in response to any event must be
carefully encapsulated. This means that the resulting system is maximally
embeddable in other software, because all the required behavior is completely
separate from the scheduling and flow of control. </p>
<p>In other words, the event monitor is the least important dimension of
the model; you can replace it with another event monitor without any sacrifice
in functionality. In fact, we provide an <a
 href="../../../contrib/MITRE/examples/simple_mainloop/description.html">example</a> 
in the distribution which substitutes a different event monitor for the default
Galaxy Communicator event monitor. Furthermore, the Python and Allegro Common
Lisp programming language bindings use their own event monitors, but invoke
the same underlying C callbacks as the default C implementation. So even
before we look at UI programming, we can derive some significant benefits
from this model. </p>
<p> </p>
<hr width="100%"> 
<h2> <a name="The_event_monitor"></a>The event monitor</h2>
 There are two strategies for implementing event monitors we'll look at:
threads and event loops. We're only going to talk about threads in passing,
but it's a valuable conceptual step to the event loop. 
<p>In the abstract, a system like this has a number of parallel threads of
execution going on. Some of these events are events which happen at particular
intervals, and others are events which happen when data is available on a
particular communications channel. These threads are conceptually separate.
You could think of a callback which is fired every 10 milliseconds as one
which is governed by an infinite loop which fires the callback, sleeps for
10 milliseconds, and repeats. Similarly, you could think of each data callback
as governed by an infinite loop which constantly tries to read data from
the communications channel, and succeeds only when data is available (a so-called
<b>blocking read</b>). </p>
<center> 
<p><img src="../../images/ThreadMonitor.jpg" nosave="" height="287"
 width="647">
</p>
</center>
  
<p>In a multithreaded programming situation, this is exactly what happens.
Each logical monitor is assigned to a programming thread. Examples of this
are when a Communicator C server is run in threaded mode (which we won't
talk about in this tutorial), or in the Java or Allegro Common Lisp programming
language bindings. In these latter cases, the threaded model is the conceptually
natural model for the language. </p>
<p>If you don't use threads (and the default C server doesn't), life is a
little more complicated. Since you can only have one infinite loop, these
conceptually independent threads of execution have to be collapsed into one: 
</p>
<center> 
<p><img src="../../images/EventLoop.jpg" nosave="" height="119"
 width="647">
</p>
</center>
 Obviously, in this case we can't sleep or do blocking reads; if we block
on one channel, we'll miss events on another channel. So we have to use an
<b>event loop</b>. Periodically, the event loop checks the communications
channels it's been told to monitor, and checks the expiration time of the
timers it's been told to monitor. When it discovers that data is available,
or that a timer has expired, it fires the appropriate callback. When the
callback finishes, the event loop continues. The default Galaxy Communicator
main loop is an event loop. 
<p> </p>
<hr width="100%"> 
<h2> <a name="Adding_UI_elements"></a>Adding UI elements</h2>
 When you add a UI element, what you're doing, essentially, is adding another
type of event to monitor. You may be monitoring standard input, or perhaps
input from audio: 
<center><img src="../../images/AddEvents.jpg" nosave="" height="215"
 width="647">
</center>
 In cases like this, the appropriate thing to do is to add these events to
the Galaxy Communicator main loop: 
<center> 
<p><img src="../../images/EventsAddedToLoop.jpg" nosave="" height="119"
 width="647">
</p>
</center>
 A well-designed main loop will allow the programmer to add and remove callbacks
for timer and data events at will; the <a
 href="../advanced/timed_tasks.html">Galaxy Communicator event loop</a> provides
these capabilities. In fact, there's even a <a
 href="../../../contrib/MITRE/utilities/docs/stdin_poll.html">utility</a> 
in the Galaxy Communicator distribution which allows you to add a standard 
input monitor to the Galaxy Communicator main loop fairly easily. This is
the utility which monitors the carriage returns in the Audio server. 
<p>However, the reason this is simple to do is that monitoring standard input,
or an audio device, usually doesn't come with its own main loop. There are
many other common tools, such as CORBA and windowing systems, which have
their own main loop. For instance, you'd encounter this problem if you wanted
to build a Communicator-compliant Motif or Tcl/Tk server: </p>
<center><img src="../../images/AddGui.jpg" nosave="" height="215"
 width="647">
</center>
 This is exactly the same problem we faced with multiple parallel threads
of execution: unless you're actually using threads, you can't have more than
one main loop running. So in these cases, either the Galaxy Communicator
main loop has to go, or the windowing main loop has to go. 
<p>Fortunately, almost all of these main loops are well-designed, in that
they support the ability to add and remove timer and data event callbacks.
And since we know that Galaxy Communicator is designed so that all the work
is done in the callbacks, and we have no idea whether the same is true for
these other systems, the appropriate thing to do is to toss out the Galaxy
Communicator main loop and monitor all the appropriate events in the other
main loop: </p>
<center> 
<p><img src="../../images/EventsInGui.jpg" nosave="" height="119"
 width="647">
</p>
</center>
 This is how the unit tester works, actually; it monitors the Communicator
events in the Python/Tk main window loop. 
<p>For external main loops implemented in C, there's a well-defined way of
doing this embedding of the Galaxy Communicator callbacks, called <a
 href="../advanced/special_mainloop.html#External_loop_records">external loop
records</a>. The <a
 href="../../../contrib/MITRE/examples/simple_mainloop/description.html">example</a> 
in the distribution which substitutes a different main loop for the Galaxy 
Communicator main loop shows how this mechanism works. </p>
<p> </p>
<hr width="100%"> 
<h2> <a name="Summary"></a>Summary</h2>
 This lesson has been fairly abstract, out of necessity; an appropriately
detailed examination of relevant code examples is far beyond the scope of
this tutorial. We believe, though, that the Galaxy Communicator distribution
contains enough examples and documentation to allow you to learn the details
on your own. 
<p>This brings us to the end of our discussion of the structure of servers.
We still have three more lessons to go. These lessons will address more details
in the Hub which will finally allow you to assemble an entire end-to-end
system. </p>
