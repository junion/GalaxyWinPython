<p>Upgrading to Galaxy Communicator 3.2 is
simple. For almost all users, there are no obligatory upgrades.
<p>This document describes only the steps
required or recommended to upgrade existing features of Galaxy Communicator.
You can find a list of new features <a href="new_features.html">here</a>.
You can find the complete release notes <a href="release_notes.html">here</a>.

<h2>
<a NAME="Updating_session_management_in_the_Hub"></a>Step
1: Updating session management in the Hub</h2>
The Hub chooses service providers based on
a number of considerations: whether they support the requested operation,
whether they're free, whether they're up, and <a href="../advanced/hub_properties.html#GalSS_EnvSetSession">what
sessions they may be restricted to supporting</a>. In version 3.1, being
the only provider for a particular service outweighed the session the provider
was restricted to supporting, so that if there was, say, only one audio
server, and it was locked to session 1, programs running tokens in session
2 would still be allowed to select that server, because it was the only
one. This behavior was incorrect, and it has been fixed.
<p>However, if you have been experimenting
with session locks and multiple sessions, it's possible that at this point
your system might stop working, because you've unwittingly relied on this
bug in 3.1. So if in 3.2, your system informs you that there are no providers
available when you believe that there are, you should consider the possibility
that you've misused session locks.

<h2>
<a NAME="Upgrading_flags_which_set_Hub_client_behavior"></a>Step
2: Upgrading flags which set Hub client behavior</h2>
When you set up a Hub client <a href="../reference/server_structure.html#Listener-in-Hub_support">programmatically</a>,
it's possible to define the behavior of the Hub client when it cannot establish
a connection, or when it loses one. As of version 3.2, it's possible to
specify that the process should shut down if it can't establish a connection,
where before it was not possible to do so. It's also possible to check
the conditions more mnemonically than before, because new masks and constants
have been added. In some cases, because the values of the constants have
changed, this change is obligatory.
<p>For instance, if you want to see if the
server was set up to retry, you would previously have need to do this:
<p><b>Version 3.1</b>
<blockquote><tt>if (!(GalIO_ServerListenStatus(scomm) &amp; GAL_HUB_CLIENT_CONNECT_FAILURE_NOOP))
{</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; ... }</tt></blockquote>
This will now do the wrong thing. The proper
(and more mnemonic)&nbsp;test is
<p>Version 3.2
<blockquote><tt>if ((GalIO_ServerListenStatus(scomm) &amp; GAL_HUB_CLIENT_CONNECT_FAILURE_MASK)
==</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GAL_HUB_CLIENT_CONNECT_FAILURE_RETRY)&nbsp;{</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; ... }</tt></blockquote>
See the documentation on <a href="../reference/server_structure.html#GalIO_ServerListenStatus">GalIO_ServerListenStatus</a>
for more details.
