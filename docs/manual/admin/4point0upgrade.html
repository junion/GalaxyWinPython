<h2> <a name="Updating_logging_support"></a>Step 1: Updating logging support</h2>
               In version 3.3 and previous, the implementation of the TIMESTAMP:
    directive    and of the implicit timestamp associated with LOG_IN:/LOG_OUT:
    in PROGRAM:    or MESSAGE: blocks was carelessly done; it arranged for
 timestamps   in situations    where it shouldn't have. We have clarified
the <a href="../reference/logging.html">rules under which this happens</a>
to ensure      that TIMESTAMP: applies anywhere, but only to messages which
match the   provided   description, and that LOG_IN:/LOG_OUT: in PROGRAM:
or MESSAGE:   <b>only</b> apply to new messages received by the Hub and replies
it sends   to the originating   server. This limitation is <b>not a change</b>,
merely   a clean implementation   of a previously documented limitation.
If you're   inadvertantly relying on   the previous implementation, you may
need to upgrade  your Hub programs. <b>Please</b> check your Hub programs
and log output.               
<p> </p>
                      
<hr width="100%">          
<h2> <a name="Update_use_of_-gui"></a>Step 2:&nbsp;Update use of <tt>-gui</tt></h2>
                   
<p>    In version 3.3, we introduced, but did not document, the ability of 
     the  Hub to contact remote servers for visualization and profiling. The
   location   of this remote server is provided to the Hub via the <a
 href="../reference/hub.html#The_Hub"><tt>-gui</tt> command line argument</a>.
  In     version 3.3, the format of this argument was <tt>direction@host:port</tt>, 
       where <tt>direction</tt> was either <tt>server</tt> (i.e., the server 
   has    the listener) or <tt>hub</tt> (i.e., the Hub should set up the listener).
      When the Hub had the listener, the <tt>host</tt> argument was ignored.
      </p>
                   
<p>In the context of cleaning up references to provider names and documenting
       the Hub GUI&nbsp;functionality, we decided that this format was not
 particularly      informative. So in 4.0, the format is <tt>host:port</tt>,
 where <tt>host</tt>    can be the distinguished string <tt>&lt;listener&gt;</tt>,
 indicating the     Hub should set up the listener.</p>
                      
<hr width="100%" size="2">         
<h2><a name="Update_use_of_variable"></a>Step 3: Update use of variable substitution</h2>
              In version 3.3, we made an incorrect assumption having to do
 with   <a href="../reference/frame.html#Gal_VAReadVarFrameFromString">Gal_VAReadVarFrameFromString</a>
    and <a href="../reference/frame.html#Gal_ReadVarFrameFromString">Gal_ReadVarFrameFromString</a>&nbsp;which
       could lead to memory leaks. In particular, our example looked like
this:<br>
                      
<blockquote><tt>Gal_VAReadVarFrameFromString("{c foo :string $a :int $b }",
       2,</tt> <br>
                <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
     "$a",&nbsp;</tt><tt>Gal_StringObject("bar")</tt><tt>, <br>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"$b", </tt><tt>Gal_IntObject(5)</tt><tt>);</tt><br>
               </blockquote>
              This invocation would have led to memory leaks if there were
 no  references     to some of the variables in the frame string. In version 
 4.0,  these functions     now assume that the programmer will manage the 
memory  for the variable  values,   and copy the variable values before substitution. 
  This both enables  the programmer  to &nbsp;ensure that &nbsp;newly-created 
  elements are freed,  and also eliminates  the possibility of multiple references 
  to the same Gal_Object   in a single  frame, which is currently not supported. 
  In 4.0, the equivalent   invocation  should look like this:<br>
                      
<blockquote><tt>Gal_Object o1 = </tt><tt>Gal_StringObject("bar")</tt><tt>;<br>
               Gal_Object o2 = </tt><tt>Gal_IntObject(5)</tt>;<br>
                 <br>
                 <tt>Gal_VAReadVarFrameFromString("{c foo :string $a :int 
$b  }",   2,</tt>    <br>
                <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
     "$a", o1, "$b", o2);<br>
               Gal_FreeObject(o1);<br>
               Gal_FreeObject(o2);<br>
              </tt></blockquote>
                    
<hr width="100%" size="2">         
<h2><a name="Update_expectations_for_missing"></a>Step 4: Update expectations
      for missing Hub programs and operations</h2>
                   
<p> In &nbsp;version 3.3, a call to&nbsp;<a
 href="../reference/adding.html#GalSS_EnvDispatchFrame">GalSS_EnvDispatchFrame</a>
    would do something somewhat unintuitive when the Hub could neither find
  a    matching Hub program nor identify a matching service type which supported
      the specified operation. The Hub would create a new message named <tt>system-error</tt>
    and process it as an incoming message. However, it would not return any
  error    to the caller. This behavior differs from the behavior of service
  providers    which are sent messages by the Hub which they don't support:
  they raise  an  error directly back to the Hub.<br>
           </p>
                   
<p>In version 4.0, we have augmented this behavior to be more consistent. 
     The Hub still generates its new message, in case Hub script programmers 
   rely  on this feature; however, instead of a normaly reply, the caller 
of   GalSS_EnvDispatchFrame  or its relatives receives an error. We highlight 
  this change in case programmers  have been inadvertantly careless about 
checking   the message type of the reply,  which should be done as follows:</p>
                    
<blockquote><tt>GalIO_MsgType t;<br>
            Gal_Frame msg, reply;<br>
              <br>
            /* ... */<br>
            reply = GalSS_EnvWriteFrame(env, msg, &amp;t);<br>
            switch (t) {<br>
            case GAL_REPLY_MSG_TYPE:<br>
            &nbsp; /* normal reply */<br>
            &nbsp; break;<br>
            case GAL_ERROR_MSG_TYPE;<br>
            &nbsp; /* error */<br>
            &nbsp; break;<br>
            default:<br>
            &nbsp; break;<br>
            }<br>
            </tt></blockquote>

<h2><a name="Upgrade_to_broker_proxies"></a>Step 5: Upgrade to broker proxies</h2>
          This &nbsp;upgrade is optional, but highly recommended. Broker
proxies     are  a considerable improvement on the original broker API.,
both because     the new broker proxies encapsulate all the broker contact
information in   a single  key whose value has a distinguished type, and
because the broker   stream can  be restricted by object type. The semantics
of the elements  flowing  over the broker connecting are also clearer; if
you receive an array  of integers,   the proxy encodes whether it's a component
of a larger array,   or an element   of a list, or just a random object transmitted
over the connection.  <br>
                  
<p>Here's a comparison of the use of brokers for streaming data, using proxies
     and raw brokers:<br>

          Note that especially on the receiving end, there's much less to 
do,   and   the callback infrastructure is handled for you, as is the assembly 
 of streaming   data into a single object. In addition to these benefits, 
and the fact that   the contact information is encapsulated and typed, it's 
also possible to  read objects from proxies without using callbacks, if you 
so choose. In general,   the new API is much more flexible and powerful. For
more information, see   the <a href="../reference/brokering.html">broker documentation</a>.<br>

        Before version 4.0, it was exceptionally hard to refer to service 
providers.    The best you could do, in a number of contexts, was refer to 
the host and    port the provider had been contacted at. This was particularly 
important   if you were using the Builtin dispatch function <a

    now that we've introduced <a

<h2><a name="Update_broker_startup"></a>Step 8: Update broker startup</h2>
    If you're using threads, and you add broker callbacks or other properties
  to your brokers or broker proxies after you create them, there's a chance
  that the broker thread will start up (and possibly finish) before the callbacks
  are added. In 4.0, we've added functionality which allows the programmer
 to create a broker without starting it up. See the new section on <a
 href="../reference/brokering.html#Delaying_broker_activation">delaying broker
  activation</a> for instructions on how to do this.<br>

    Adding the functionality to <a

two   of the <a

  associated with brokers. These events are accepted by the function <a

  In versions 3.3 and previous, the events&nbsp;<tt>GAL_CONNECTION_BROKER_OUT_STARTUP_EVENT</tt>
  and <tt>GAL_CONNECTION_BROKER_IN_STARTUP_EVENT</tt> were documented as
being   fired when a broker was created. In version 4.0, these events have
been redefined  as being fired when a broker is started. Before 4.0, it was
not possible to create a broker without starting it; now that this is possible,
we've added two new events,&nbsp;<tt>GAL_CONNECTION_BROKER_OUT_CREATION_EVENT</tt>
 and&nbsp;<tt>GAL_CONNECTION_BROKER_IN_CREATION_EVENT</tt>, which are fired
 when the broker is created.<br>

<h2><a name="Upgrade_Java_servers"></a>Step 10: Upgrade Java servers</h2>
       There are a number of changes in the 4.0 Java bindings that are incompatible 
   with earlier releases. <br>
             
<ul>
         <li>The Java&nbsp; <tt><a
 href="../../../contrib/MITRE/bindings/java/docs/galaxy/server/DataInBroker.html">DataInBroker</a></tt> 
    constructors now throw <tt>IOException</tt>.&nbsp;</li>
         <li>The Java <tt>galaxy.lang.BinaryObject</tt>  class  has  been 
removed    (it had been deprecated since 3.0). The various Galaxy Communicator 
 array    objects are now implemented as <tt><a
 href="../../../contrib/MITRE/bindings/java/docs/galaxy/lang/ArrayObject.html">ArrayObjects</a></tt> 
    in the Java bindings. Related to this, the deprecated byte[]-based constructors 
       for the numerical array objects have been removed, as has the <tt><a
 href="../../../contrib/MITRE/bindings/java/docs/galaxy/io/GalaxyOutputStream.html">GalaxyOutputStream</a> 
   write(BinaryObject, int)</tt> method.</li>
         <li>The Java bindings now encode/decode   XDR  strings using the 
ISO-8859-1    encoding. Previously, UTF-8 was used, but  this  is not compatible 
with  the  encoding/decoding support used by the other  language  bindings. 
This  change  should be transparent to the developer unless strings that require
 UTF-8 encoding were being exchanged between Java servers.&nbsp;</li>
         <li>All Java code that was deprecated  in  Galaxy Communicator 3.0 
 has   been removed. See the <a href="release_notes.html">release notes</a> 
 for  details.&nbsp;</li>
         <li>As an optional upgrade, support for broker proxies is provided 
 in  the Java bindings. See the <a
 href="../../../contrib/MITRE/bindings/java/index.html#Using_Broker_Proxies">Java 
   notes</a> for details.</li>
             
</ul>
     
<hr width="100%" size="2">   
<h2><a name="Upgrade_use_of_EXPAND:"></a>Step 11: Upgrade use of <tt>EXPAND:</tt> 
 in process monitor configuration files</h2>
   In version 3.3, the <a
 href="../../../contrib/MITRE/tools/docs/process_monitor_ref.html#Configuration_file">process 
 monitor configuration file</a> permitted directives such as the following:<br>
     
<blockquote><tt>EXPAND: $TEMP</tt><br>
   </blockquote>
   The interpretation of this entry is that <tt>$TEMP</tt> would be bound,
 in each process block, to a unique temporary file name which could be passed 
 around in that process block. However, as a result, it was impossible to 
define an empty expansion. This latter functionality became desirable in the
context of defining configuration files which could run on either Unix or
Windows. Therefore, &nbsp;in 4.0, the entry shown here does expand to the
empty string, and we've introduced the <tt>TEMPFILE:</tt> directive to provide
explicit temporary file substitutions.<br>
  <br>
   
<hr width="100%" size="2">  
<h2><a name="Upgrade_argument_lists_of_Server_class"></a>Step 12: Upgrade
 argument lists of Server class in Python</h2>
  As part of the upgrade to <a href="../advanced/server_locations.html">server
 location files</a>, we've added an argument to the Server class in Python
 for the name of the entry in the server location file, analogous to the
<tt>-slf_name</tt>  argument in C. For coherence, we've added this argument
immediately after  the argument for the server location file, which means
that anyone who relies  on the order of the arguments to the Server class
constructor will need to  add an additional argument. This should only affect
programmers who are inheriting  from the Server class, since there are so
many arguments to the constructor  which are seldom overwritten that relying
on ordered arguments would be counterproductive  in most cases. If you encounter
the problem, you'll recognize it because you'll suddenly start getting <tt>TypeError:
not a string</tt> when the internal  function cGalaxy._GBGalSS_EncapsulateArguments
is called.<br>
 <br>
 
<hr width="100%" size="2"> 
<h2><a name="Upgrade_use_of_host_and_port"></a>Step 13: Upgrade use of host 
and port override rules for <tt>-locations</tt> and <tt>-server_locations_file</tt><br>
 </h2>
 As part of upgrading references to provider names, we encountered some inconsistencies 
in the server locations file <a
 href="../advanced/server_locations.html#The_Hubs_view_of_the_server_locations">override 
rules</a> in the Hub. Among other things, it was possible to change where
the listener was in the file but not on the command line. These rules have
now been rationalized. However, this rationalization appears to have introduced
some incompatible changes. We can't reconstruct all of them, but one of them
appears to be that the way to override a Hub listener port has changed. Previously,
the following declaration <br>
<blockquote><tt>SERVICE_TYPE: foo<br>
CLIENT_PORT: 2700</tt><br>
</blockquote>
could have its CLIENT_PORT: value overridden by this command line argument:<br>
<blockquote><tt>... -locations "foo@ignore:2900" ...</tt><br>
</blockquote>
However, in 4.0, the assumption is that any host name which is present indicates
that the Hub should expect the listener to be on that host; so in 4.0, this
declaration would remove the listener and add a service provider for <tt>foo</tt>
which is expected to be found on the host <tt>ignore</tt> at port 2900. In
order to achieve the intended effect in 4.0, you should use the special <tt>&lt;listener&gt;</tt>
token:<br>
<blockquote><tt>... -locations "foo@&lt;listener&gt;:2900" ...</tt><br>
</blockquote>
This syntax is also consistent with the <a href="#Update_use_of_-gui">upgraded
format for the <tt>-gui</tt> Hub argument</a>.<br>
