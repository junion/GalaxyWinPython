<p>By default, servers start up listeners on their default ports, and the
  Hub contacts them. Alternatively, you can set up a <a
 href="hub_listener.html">listener in the Hub</a> and have the server contact
  the Hub instead. In both these cases, the programmer needs to make sure
that  the <a href="../reference/pgm.html#Server_Declarations">server entries
in  the Hub program file</a>, the <a
 href="../reference/adding.html#Declare_server_information">default server
  header</a>, and the <a
 href="../reference/adding.html#_GalSS_init_server">server command line arguments</a>
  all correspond to each other, so that the Hub and servers can connect.
Not   only can this be a difficult and unreliable procedure, but it's also
possible   that multiple instances of the same Communicator system might
be running  at the same site on different sets of machines. In this latter
case, the scripts and program files for the system would typically have to
be modified for each invocation (or separate versions would need to be maintained).
The overhead of this chore can be extremely frustrating. </p>
       
<p>In version 3.0, we've implemented a simple solution to address this issue.

<h2> The server locations file</h2>
    Both the Hub and servers now accept a <tt>-server_locations_file</tt> 
command line argument which names a file which describes where the listeners 
are located. The format  of each meaningful line of this file should be as 
follows:     
<p><tt>&lt;entry_name&gt; &lt;listener_host_or_ip&gt;":"&lt;listener_port&gt;
  ["hub"|"server"]</tt> </p>
       
<p>In other words, each entry is a triple, with the entries delimited by whitespace.
The first element of each triple is an entry name, which is a character sequence.
The second entry is a token consisting of a host name or IP address, followed
by a colon (":"), followed by a port number. The third entry is either the
token <tt>hub</tt> or the token <tt>server</tt>. We've provided an <a
 href="#An_example">example</a>.<br>
 </p>
 
<p>    In addition to the meaningful lines described above, all lines consisting
  entirely of whitespace are ignored, as are all lines whose first non-whitespace
  character is a hash mark ("#"). There can be any nonempty amount of whitespace
 in  between the three tokens in each meaningful line.<br>
 </p>
 
<p>The interpretation of this file differs slightly depending on whether
the Hub or a server is looking at it. We'll start with the Hub side.<br>
    </p>
       
<h3><a name="The_Hubs_view_of_the_server_locations"></a>The Hub's view of
  the server locations file<br>
    </h3>
       
<p>On the Hub side, <tt>&lt;server_name&gt;</tt> is either a <a
 href="provider_id.html#The_syntax_of_provider_names">provider name</a> or 
 the name of a <a href="../reference/pgm.html#Service_types">service type</a>. 
 If the third element is the token <tt>hub</tt>, then the Hub uses <tt>&lt;listener_port&gt;</tt>
  as the port to set up a listener on, and <tt>&lt;listener_host_or_ip&gt;</tt>
  is ignored. If the third element is the token <tt>server</tt>, the Hub
uses&nbsp;  <tt>&lt;listener_host_or_ip&gt;:&lt;listener_port&gt;</tt>  as
the contact  information to use for updating on of its provider specifications.
 Each line is treated as a separate entry.<br>
    </p>
       
<p>In general, each entry is able to override an existing declaration, and
  even switch the direction of connectivity, as long as there's no more than
  one element to override. Specifically, the rules for matching are as follows:</p>
       
<ul>
      <li>If the entry specifies creating a listener, then the entry's hostname 
  can't have a provider ID.</li>
      <li>If the entry specifies creating a listener and the Hub already
has   a listener for the specified service type, use the port information
to override.</li>
      <li>If the entry specifies creating a listener and the Hub has no listener 
  for the specified service type and no more than one server to contact, remove
  the server if present and set up a listener using the specified port information.</li>
      <li>If the entry specifies creating a listener and the Hub has no listener 
  for the specified service type, but more than one server to contact, skip 
  the entry.</li>
      <li>If the entry does not specify creating a listener, find all providers 
  known to the Hub which match the hostname. If there are no more than one,
  shut down the listener for the named provider, if it exists, and either
update  the single match according to the contact information in the entry,
or introduce  a new provider which matches the contact information in the
entry. If more  than one matching provider is found, do nothing.</li>
       
</ul>
       
<h3><a name="The_servers_view_of_the_server_location"></a>The server's view
  of the server location file<br>
    </h3>
       
<p>On the server side, things are a little different. First, the server is
  only looking for one entry: the one that it matches. It identifies this
entry  by matching the <tt>&lt;server_name&gt;</tt>. By default, it uses
its own  name (that is, the value of the <a
 href="../reference/adding.html#Basics"><tt>GAL_SERVER_NAME</tt> macro</a>).
  However, sometimes that's not useful. For instance, when the <tt>&lt;server_name&gt;</tt>
  is a Hub provider name, the server has no way of matching this entry against
  its own name, since the provider names are assigned by the Hub. If you
want  to provide an alternate name for the server to look up an entry in
the server  locations file, use the <tt>-slf_name</tt> argument.<br>
    </p>
       
<p>If the third element of the matched entry is <tt>hub</tt>, the server
updates itself to contact the Hub ad&nbsp;<tt>&lt;listener_host_or_ip&gt;:&lt;listener_port&gt;</tt>
  . If the third element of the matched entry is the token <tt>server</tt>, 
the server  updates itself to set up a listener on&nbsp;<tt>&lt;listener_port&gt;</tt>,
  and&nbsp;<tt>&lt;listener_host_or_ip&gt;</tt> is ignored. <br>
    </p>
       
<h3><a name="An_example"></a>An example<br>
     </h3>
       
<p>For example, the following server locations file describes a situation
  where the Hub has a listener on port 3600 listening for connections from
 a provider of service type <tt>multiply</tt>, and a server which the Hub
knows as having the provider name <tt>[double]</tt> opens up its own listener
on port 5200. In addition, the <tt>multiply</tt> server will try to find
that Hub listener on <tt>bolcom.mitre.org</tt> (so the Hub had better be
running on that machine), and the Hub will try to find the <tt>[double]</tt>
listener   on <tt>feta.mitre.org</tt> (so the <tt>[double]</tt> server had
better be  running on that machine): </p>
       
<p><tt>multiply bolcom.mitre.org:3600 hub</tt> <br>
    <tt>[double] &nbsp; feta.mitre.org:5200 server</tt> </p>
       
<p>So as long as the Hub starts up on <tt>bolcom.mitre.org</tt> and is passed
  this server locations file, and as long as the <tt>double</tt> server starts
  up on <tt>feta.mitre.org</tt> and is passed this server locations file
with   the appropriate index into the file, and as long as the <tt>multiply</tt> 
  server starts up <b>some</b>where and is passed this server locations file, 
  this system configuration will initialize itself appropriately: </p>
       
<p><tt>bolcom.mitre.org$ hub -server_locations_file double.loc</tt> <br>
    <tt>---------------------------------------------------------</tt> <br>
    <tt>feta.mitre.org$ double -server_locations_file double.loc -slf_name
 "[double]"</tt><br>
    <tt>----------------------------------------------------------</tt> <br>
    <tt>somewhere.mitre.org$ multiply -server_locations double.loc</tt> </p>
       
<p>The result is that it's possible to configure a suite of servers and Hub
  with a single configuration file, and no scripts or program files need
to   be changed. </p>
       
<p><b>Note</b>: this utility does not currently provide a facility for ensuring
  that the listener is started on the correct host. The crudest version of
 this support would be to shut down if the specified host wasn't the host
the listener was running on, but it's not clear whether this would work for
DHCP connections, for instance. </p>
           
<h3> Server locations files and other command line arguments</h3>
     The server locations files override all other port information. On the 
 Hub side, it supersedes the host and port information in the program file 
 and in the <tt>-locations</tt> command line argument. On the server side, 
 it supersedes the information in the server declaration header file, as well
 as the <tt>-port</tt> and <tt>-contact_hub</tt> command line arguments.
 On  both the Hub and server sides, the specified port for the listener is
 required;  the listener startup process will not search for the first available
 port,  but rather fail if the specified port is not available.     
<p><b>Note</b>: this override mechanism only works in the Hub when there
is at most one service provider for the named service type. </p>
