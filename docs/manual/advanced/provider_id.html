<hr width="100%">    
<p>The Galaxy Communicator infrastructure has evolved considerably in the 
 way it handles references to servers. The Hub, for instance, makes the distinction 
 between <a href="../reference/pgm.html#Service_types">service types</a>, 
which is a set of operations the Hub can perform, and <a
 href="../reference/pgm.html#Service_providers">service providers</a>, which 
 are the individual Communicator-compliant servers which implement these operations.
 </p>
     
<p>In version 4.0, we have enhanced and rendered consistent the way programmers 
 can refer to these service providers. Until this release, it was possible 
 to describe providers in various ways (e.g., by their service type), but 
not to identify them uniquely. This could be a problem in situations where, 
for instance, the programmer desires to use only <a
 href="synch_vs_asynch.html#Invocations">asynchronous invocations</a> to support
<a href="synch_vs_asynch.html#Interactions">synchronous interactions</a>,
  but the Hub maintains connections to multiple providers of the affected
type. If the programmer was either unwilling or unable to <a
 href="hub_properties.html#GalSS_EnvSetSession">lock the server to the session</a>, 
 or if the session itself could make use of multiple providers for the affected 
 type (for load balancing, for instance), the programmer had no other options. 
 Now, provider names fill this gap. </p>
     
<p> </p>
     
<hr width="100%">    
<h2> <a name="The_syntax_of_provider_names"></a>The syntax of provider names</h2>
    The syntax of provider names is as follows:    
<blockquote><tt>"["&lt;id&gt;"]"(&lt;service_type&gt;)</tt></blockquote>
That is, the provider name begins with a left square bracket ("["), followed
by an ID, followed by a right square bracket ("]"), followed optionally by
the name of a service type (declared by either the <a
 href="../reference/pgm.html#SERVICE_TYPE:">SERVICE_TYPE:</a> or <a
 href="../reference/pgm.html#SERVER:">SERVER:</a> directives in the Hub script).<br>
<br>
We call the bracket-delimited portion the <b>provider ID</b>. The <tt>&lt;id&gt;</tt> 
can be either an integer or a string. Here are some examples:    
<blockquote><tt>[4]</tt> <br>
     <tt>[myparser]Parser</tt> <br>
     <tt>[17]Dialogue</tt></blockquote>
    The integers are assigned by the Hub when the Hub first learns of the 
existence  of each provider: either one it should contact, or one that contacts 
it. The non-integer IDs are assigned by the Hub programmer, as follows:  
 
<blockquote><tt>SERVICE_PROVIDER: Parser</tt> <br>
     <tt>PROVIDER_ID: [myparser]</tt></blockquote>
    These provider names are used in a number of different contexts, which
 we describe here and in the <a href="../reference/pgm.html">Hub program
reference</a>  document.    
<h3> <a name="Extended_provider_names"></a>Extended provider names</h3>
    In a number of contexts, provider names can be optionally extended with 
 a location suffix. This location suffix is the same format as the value of
 the <a href="../reference/pgm.html#LOCATION:">LOCATION:</a>&nbsp;directive
  in the Hub scripts. The suffix is attached with an at sign ("@"):    
<blockquote><tt>[7]Parser@foo.bar.com:1567</tt></blockquote>
        
<hr width="100%">    
<h2> <a name="Selecting_a_provider"></a>Selecting a provider</h2>
    Provider names can impose restrictions on how the Hub selects providers.
    
<p>The Hub selects a provider to use according to the following rules. These 
 rules apply either to <a href="scriptless.html">scriptless interaction</a> 
 or to the RHS of <a href="../reference/pgm.html#Rules">Hub program rules</a>.
  </p>
     
<h3> The basic requirements</h3>
    First, the provider must minimally satisfy three requirements:    
<h4> The provider must be available</h4>
    In order to be available, a provider must be connected, idle (not busy
 with another operation for another token), and not <a
 href="hub_properties.html#GalSS_EnvSetSession">locked to another session</a>.
    
<h4> The provider must support the specified operation</h4>
    The RHS of the rule must be listed in the <a
 href="../reference/pgm.html#OPERATIONS:">OPERATIONS:</a> list of one of the
service types associated with the provider.    
<h4> The provider must satisfy the specified service type or service provider 
 conditions, if present</h4>
    The service provider must satisfy whatever conditions are specified by
 the relevant <a href="../reference/pgm.html#CONDITIONS:">CONDITIONS:</a>
directives.    
<h3> <a name="Service_type_and_provider_prefixes"></a>Service type and provider 
 prefixes</h3>
    In addition to these requirements, it's possible to narrow the range
of  provider selection by attaching a prefix to the operation name, separated 
 from the operator by a period ("."). This prefix can be either a service 
type or a provider name.    
<p>If the operation name prefix is the name of a service type, the Hub restricts 
 its search to providers of that type. This restriction can be valuable if 
 multiple service types support the same operation. For example, the following 
 rule directs the Hub to consider only those providers of service type <tt>jupiter</tt>:
  </p>
     
<blockquote><tt>RULE: :request_frame &amp; :key_value &amp; :domain Jupiter
  --&gt; jupiter.turn_management</tt></blockquote>
    Alternatively, if an incoming message named <tt>jupiter.turn_management</tt>
  matches no program name (i.e., it's <a href="scriptless.html">scriptless</a>),
  the Hub will consider relaying it only to providers of service type <tt>jupiter</tt>.
    
<p>The operation name prefix can also be a provider name. In this case, the 
 Hub will consider only one provider, namely the one with the specified name. 
 For example, the following rule directs the Hub to consider only the provider 
 with id 1: </p>
     
<blockquote><tt>RULE: :request_frame &amp; :key_value &amp; :domain Jupiter
  --&gt; [1].turn_management</tt></blockquote>
    In the scriptless case (i.e., if the Hub receives a message named <tt>[1].turn_management</tt>
  which matches no program), the same restriction would apply.<br>
  <br>
  Finally, you can use the PROVIDER_NAME: directive to add a provider  name
restriction. The advantage of this directive is that it can be any value;
 so if you've stored the provider name in a key in the token, you can refer
 to that key:<tt><br>
  </tt>  
<blockquote><tt>RULE: :request_frame &amp; :key_value &amp; :domain Jupiter
  --&gt; turn_management<br>
  PROVIDER_NAME: :stored_provider<br>
    </tt></blockquote>
      
<h3>What if you don't know the name or ID of the provider you're interested 
in?</h3>
 If you're interested in referring to a provider by name in a program file, 
then be sure to give it a PROVIDER_ID: directive when you declare it. If it's
a server which contacts the Hub, then your life is a little more complicated. 
If the provider sends a new message to the Hub at any point (ideally, when 
it connects), you can call the Builtin function <a
 href="../../servers/builtin.html#hub_token_owner">hub_token_owner</a> to 
retrieve the provider ID of the originating provider. If it doesn't, you're 
currently out of luck.<br>
 
<h3> Other conditions</h3>
    If the provider is "write-locked" to the current session (that is, if 
the  session is required to send all its output to that provider when it can),
 that provider will be the only one considered. The Hub also provides <a
 href="../reference/pgm.html#Selecting_a_provider">additional functionality</a> 
 which can be used to affect provider selection in Hub programs.    
<h3> Once the candidates are chosen</h3>
    If multiple providers satisfy all the requirements, the Hub makes a random 
 choice among them (there is no broadcast option yet). If no candidate fulfills 
 all the requirements, but there is a chance that one will (i.e., it's eligible 
 except for not being idle at the moment), the Hub will queue the message. 
 However, the Hub currently considers some situations irrecoverable, and will
 not queue the message. This is not and has never been implemented consistently; 
 it will be fixed in a later release, we hope.    
<p> </p>
     
<hr width="100%">    
<h2> <a name="Bypassing_Hub_programs"></a>Bypassing Hub programs</h2>
    When the Hub receives a new message, it tries to find a program which 
matches  the message name. This match is an identical string match, and it 
ignores  the significance of the <a
 href="#Service_type_and_provider_prefixes">dot  notation</a>. This means 
that even if the provider intends to route the message to a particular provider, 
and tries to impose this routing by use of the dot notation, the Hub program 
can override this intention. For instance, the following programs would override 
this apparent intention in the <a
 href="#Service_type_and_provider_prefixes">dot notation</a> examples:  
 
<blockquote><tt>PROGRAM: jupiter.turn_management</tt> <br>
     <tt>...</tt>          
  <p><tt>PROGRAM: [1].turn_management</tt> <br>
     <tt>...</tt></p>
   </blockquote>
    The Communicator infrastructure does provide a way to bypass this potential 
 override (i.e., force a scriptless interaction). The functions GalSS_EnvWriteFrameToProvider 
 and GalSS_EnvDispatchFrameToProvider accomplish this.    
<p>int&nbsp;<a name="GalSS_EnvWriteFrameToProvider"></a><b><big>GalSS_EnvWriteFrameToProvider</big></b>(GalSS_Environment
  *<i>env</i>, Gal_Frame <i>frame</i>, const char *<i>provider_id</i>, int 
 <i>do_block</i>) <br>
   Like <a href="../reference/adding.html#GalSS_EnvWriteFrame">GalSS_EnvWriteFrame</a>,
  but directs the message to the provider name or service type name specified
  by <i>provider_id</i> and bypasses Hub program matching. </p>
     
<p>Gal_Frame&nbsp;<a name="GalSS_EnvDispatchFrameToProvider"></a><b><big>GalSS_EnvDispatchFrameToProvider</big></b>(GalSS_Environment
  *<i>env</i>, Gal_Frame <i>frame</i>, const char *<i>provider_id</i>, GalIO_MsgType
  *<i>t</i>) <br>
   Like <a href="../reference/adding.html#GalSS_EnvDispatchFrame">GalSS_EnvDispatchFrame</a>,
  but directs the message to the provider name or service type name specified
  by <i>provider_id</i> and bypasses Hub program matching. </p>
     
<p>If you need to know the name of the provider you want to direct the message 
 to, you can retrieve it in one of two ways: either by using the <a
 href="../reference/pgm.html#$id">$id entity reference function</a> or the 
 function GalSS_EnvGetOriginatingProvider. </p>
     
<p>char *<a name="GalSS_EnvGetOriginatingProvider"></a><b><big>GalSS_EnvGetOriginatingProvider</big></b>(GalSS_Environment
  *<i>env</i>) <br>
   This function returns the provider name of the provider associated with
 the environment <i>env</i> which originated the token (i.e., sent the new
 message which caused the Hub to create the token). This provider name will
 be available in the context of a dispatch function invocation, and will
be  stored in any environment (or a copy of any such environment) which is
created  for this purpose, because this information is provided by the Hub
along with  each dispatch function invocation. If the environment <i>env</i>
doesn't have this information recorded (e.g., if it wasn't created for a
dispatch function invocation), this function returns NULL. </p>
