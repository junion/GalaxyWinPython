<p>As of version 2.0, the Hub does not require
Hub programs to run. The Hub still requires a configuration file, because
it still must know how to do its logging and how to contact servers. In
this document, we discuss some of the options available to the developer
for scriptless interaction.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h2>
Omitting Hub programs</h2>
Currently, we have chosen to implement scriptless
interaction by making Hub programs optional. That means that a <a href="../reference/pgm.html">Hub
program file</a> need not contain any PROGRAM: or RULE: declarations in
order for the Hub to function. The user may still choose to provide any
of the <a href="../reference/pgm.html#Global_Declarations">global declarations</a>;
<a href="../reference/pgm.html#Server_Declarations">server
declarations</a> are still required, and the only way to enable logging
is to use the <a href="../reference/pgm.html#Logfile_Instructions">logging
parameters</a>.
<p>When the Hub receives a message and there
is no program to claim it, the Hub searches its list of servers for a server
which has declared an operation which is identical to the message name.
Let's say the Hub receives a message of this form:
<blockquote><tt>{c parse</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; :input_string "I want to fly to Denver" }</tt></blockquote>
If there is a Hub program named <tt>parse</tt>,
that program will claim the message and process it, regardless of whether
there's an operation named <tt>parse</tt>.
In the following program file, the message sent to the parser server will
be <tt>parse_string</tt>, not <tt>parse</tt>:
<blockquote><tt>SERVER: parser</tt>
<br><tt>OPERATIONS: parse parse_string</tt>
<p><tt>PROGRAM: parse</tt>
<p><tt>RULE: :input_string --> parser.parse_string</tt>
<br><tt>IN: :input_string</tt>
<br><tt>OUT: :frame</tt></blockquote>
However, if there were no program named <tt>parse</tt>,
the Hub would pass the incoming message directly to one of the providers
for the <tt>parse</tt> operation, and
the <tt>parse</tt> operation would
be invoked. The specific provider is chosen according to the <a href="provider_id.html#Selecting_a_provider">rules
for provider selection</a>.
<p>What this means is that the developer doesn't
need to choose fully scripted or fully scriptless; it's possible to construct
a "partially scripted" program file, where some new messages are claimed
by programs and others are not.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h2>
Logging</h2>
Previous to version 2.0, it was possible to
log only the invocation of a program rule. This meant that logging in scriptless
mode would have been impossible. In 2.0, it is possible to log incoming
messages and their returns to the calling server. We give a brief summary
here; see the <a href="../reference/logging.html#Parameters_within_the_Scope_of_a_Program_or_Message">logging
documentation</a> for details.
<p>First, the TIMESTAMP: declaration now applies
indiscriminately to operations and programs:
<blockquote><tt>SERVER: parser</tt>
<br><tt>OPERATIONS: parse parse_string</tt>
<p><tt>TIMESTAMP: parse parse_string</tt>
<p><tt>PROGRAM: parse</tt>
<p><tt>RULE: :input_string --> parser.parse_string</tt>
<br><tt>IN: :input_string</tt>
<br><tt>OUT: :frame</tt></blockquote>
In our example here, the log will contain
a timestamp for when the <tt>parse</tt>
request arrived on the Hub, as well as when the <tt>parse_string</tt>
operation was sent to the parser server. Because timestamps are indiscriminate,
the program doesn't have to be present in order for a timestamp to happen;
so if the <tt>parse</tt> program is
removed, the incoming timestamp will still happen.
<p>Second, it is now possible to add LOG_IN:
and LOG_OUT: declarations outside the scope of a rule, and the new MESSAGE:
declaration supports in and out logging for scriptless rules. So either
of the following program files will result in a time being recorded for
the incoming <tt>parse</tt> message:
<blockquote><tt>SERVER: parser</tt>
<br><tt>OPERATIONS: parse parse_string</tt>
<p><tt>TIMESTAMP: parse parse_string</tt>
<p><tt>PROGRAM: parse</tt>
<br><tt>LOG_IN: :input_string</tt>
<p><tt>RULE: :input_string --> parser.parse_string</tt>
<br><tt>IN: :input_string</tt>
<br><tt>OUT: :frame</tt>
<p><tt>--------------------------------------------------</tt>
<p><tt>SERVER: parser</tt>
<br><tt>OPERATIONS: parse parse_string</tt>
<p><tt>TIMESTAMP: parse parse_string</tt>
<p><tt>MESSAGE: parse</tt>
<br><tt>LOG_IN: :input_string</tt></blockquote>
In this way, all the possibilities for logging
are still available for scriptless interaction.

<h2>
Writing your own scripting module</h2>
In principle, it is possible to write your
own scripting module, by altering the SCRIPTING variables in config.make
and providing your own library which implements the scripting API. However,
we have not tested this functionality. We do know that because we use MIT
scripting to provide server and logging declarations, your scripting module
would currently have to supply equivalent declaration facilities.
