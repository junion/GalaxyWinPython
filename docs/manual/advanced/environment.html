<p>Let's say you want to write a frame to the Hub, but you don't want to do
it from a dispatch function. You need an environment to use, so you save a
reference to the environment from within a dispatch function. But later, when
you try to write your frame, your application crashes. What went wrong? The
answer lies in the memory management rules for environment objects, which 
 is the topic of this section.<br>

<h2><a name="Whats_the_problem"></a>   What's the problem?</h2>
 As we saw in the <a
 href="../tutorial/errors.html#Environments_and_message_returns">tutorial</a>, 
the call environment instantiates the information required to communicate 
properly with the Hub. Much of the time, this communication happens from within
a dispatch function, which is where call environments are found:<br>
 
<blockquote><tt>Gal_Frame do_something(Gal_Frame f, void *server_data)<br>
 {<br>
 &nbsp; GalSS_Environment *env = (GalSS_Environment *) server_data;<br>
 &nbsp; Gal_Frame new_f;<br>
   <br>
 &nbsp; /* ... */<br>
 &nbsp; GalSS_EnvWriteFrame(env, new_f, 0);<br>
 &nbsp; /* ... */<br>
 }</tt><br>
 </blockquote>
 
<p>(We talk about this in more detail in the <a
 href="../reference/adding.html#Dispatch_functions_and_call_environments">documentation
  on adding a server</a>.) These call  environments can be used inside dispatch 
functions to <a href="../reference/adding.html#Replying_to_the_Hub">provide 
replies</a>  or <a href="../reference/adding.html#Invoking_the_Hub">send new
messages to the Hub</a>. But dispatch functions aren't restricted to providing
a reply  to an incoming message or sending new messages; they can also set
up callbacks  or timed tasks which may send new messages later. So the programmer
might want to save away a call environment to send a message outside the
scope of the dispatch function. However, if you're not careful, you can crash
your program doing this. The reason is that the call environment is allocated
for the call to the dispatch function, and freed (under normal circumstances)
when the dispatch function exits. So if you touch it later, it'll be gone.<br>
 </p>
 
<p>In order to address this issue, we've set up the call environment so that 
it's managed by a <b>reference count</b>. When the reference count reaches 
0, the call environment is freed. As a programmer, there are a number of ways
you can exploit this feature to ensure that the environment will be around
when you need it.<br>
 </p>

<h2><a name="Functions_which_save_away_environments"></a>Functions which save
away environments for you</h2>
    
<p>There are a number of circumstances where you might logically want to save
away a call environment. These include broker callbacks and timed tasks. In
order to make your job easier, we provide utilities for cleanly saving a
call environment in all the callback contexts the infrastructure supports. 
<br>
 </p>
 
<p>In particular, the Galaxy Communicator library provides  environment-aware 
<a href="../reference/brokering.html#GalSS_EnvBrokerDataInInit">broker callback</a> 
 and timed task setup, as well as a way of maintaining an environment through 
 successive calls to dispatch functions. In this section, we describe some 
 of these functions. </p>
     
<p>void&nbsp;<a name="GalSS_TaskSetEnvironment"></a><b><big>GalSS_TaskSetEnvironment</big></b>(Gal_TaskPkg
  *<i>p</i>, GalSS_Environment *<i>env</i>) <br>
   Sets the environment associated with the task <i>p</i> to <i>env</i>.
</p>
     
<p>GalSS_Environment *<a name="GalSS_TaskGetEnvironment"></a><b><big>GalSS_TaskGetEnvironment</big></b>(Gal_TaskPkg
  *<i>p</i>) <br>
   Returns the environment associated with the task <i>p</i>. </p>
     
<p>Gal_TaskPkg *<a name="GalSS_EnvAddTask"></a><b><big>GalSS_EnvAddTask</big></b>(GalSS_Environment
  *<i>env</i>, void (*<i>task</i>)(Gal_TaskPkg *), void *<i>caller_data</i>,
  long <i>num_millisecs</i>, int <i>read_blocking_available</i>, GAL_SOCKET
  *<i>read_socket</i>, GAL_SOCKET *<i>write_socket</i>, GAL_SOCKET *<i>err_socket</i>,
  FILE *<i>read_file</i>, FILE *<i>write_file</i>, FILE*<i>err_file</i>,
Gal_TaskConditionFn  <i>condition</i>, void (*<i>cleanup_fn</i>)(void *))
<br>
   This function provides all the functionality of <a
 href="timed_tasks.html#Gal_AddTaskExtended">Gal_AddTaskExtended</a>, but 
 also saves away the call environment <i>env</i> for access using the function 
 GalSS_TaskGetEnvironment. A task thus established can be refired in any of
 the normal ways; see the <a href="timed_tasks.html">timed task documentation</a> 
 for details. </p>
     
<p>At times, connections may be associated with UI elements, which can issue 
 new messages. So the UI itself is an element outside the scope of dispatch 
 functions where it would be helpful to have a call environment to use to 
issue new messages. It's not enough to set up the environment when the connection 
 is established; crucial properties of the UI interaction, such as the session 
 ID, may be changed by other servers in the course of evaluation. The safest 
 thing to do is to create an environment for the UI when the connection is 
 established, update it every time a dispatch function is called, and free 
 the environment when the connection is shut down. The function GalSS_EnvMaintainInLocation 
 does this for you. </p>
     
<p>void&nbsp;<a name="GalSS_EnvMaintainInLocation"></a><b><big>GalSS_EnvMaintainInLocation</big></b>(GalIO_CommStruct
  *<i>gcomm</i>, const char *<i>initial_session_id</i>, GalSS_Environment
**<i>env_loc</i>)  <br>
   The connection <i>gcomm</i> is the connection to the Hub which is associated 
 with a UI element for the current session, and hosts the dispatch functions 
 which are fired. This function seeds the location <i>env_loc</i> with a new
 environment and updates its session ID to <i>initial_session_id</i>. It
sets  a dispatch function callback via <a
 href="../reference/server_structure.html#GalIO_AddConnectionDispatchFnCallback">GalIO_AddConnectionDispatchFnCallback
  </a>to keep the location current, and sets up a shutdown callback to free 
 the environment. </p>
     
<p> </p>
     
<hr width="100%">    
<h2> <a name="Saving_away_environments_by_hand"></a>Saving away environments 
by hand</h2>
    There are a number of functions which store away an environment for later 
 use in a callback, for example <a href="#GalSS_EnvAddTask">GalSS_EnvAddTask</a>
  and <a href="../reference/brokering.html#GalSS_EnvBrokerDataInInit">GalIO_EnvBrokerDataInInit</a>.
  These functions increment a reference count associated with the environment,
  so that the environment isn't freed prematurely. However, there may be
situations in which you want to save the environment way yourself. If you
save the environment   away by hand, in your own memory location, you <b>must</b>
protect it using the same mechanisms. You can either increment and decrement
the reference counters, and share the environment, or, if you don't need
the environment to be shared,  you can copy the environment instead of locking
it,  which is safer in a multithreaded environment (the environment reference
count currently has no mutex associated with it).    
<p>void&nbsp;<a name="GalSS_EnvLock"></a><b><big>GalSS_EnvLock</big></b>(GalSS_Environment
  *<i>env</i>) <br>
   Increments the reference counter on the environment <i>env</i> to indicate 
 that it should not be freed. </p>
     
<p>void&nbsp;<a name="GalSS_EnvUnlock"></a><b><big>GalSS_EnvUnlock</big></b>(GalSS_Environment
  *<i>env</i>) <br>
   Decrements the reference counter on the environment <i>env</i>. When the 
 reference counter reaches 0, the environment is freed. </p>
     
<p>GalSS_Environment *<a name="GalSS_EnvCopy"></a><b><big>GalSS_EnvCopy</big></b>(GalSS_Environment
  *<i>old_env</i>) <br>
   Copies the environment <i>old_env</i> and sets the reference counter in
 the new environment to 1. </p>
     
<p>GalSS_Environment *<a name="GalSS_EnvCopyNoLock"></a><b><big>GalSS_EnvCopyNoLock</big></b>(GalSS_Environment
  *<i>old_env</i>) <br>
   Copies the environment <i>old_env</i>. The reference counter in the new
 environment remains at 0. This function is present mostly for internal backward
 compatibility.  </p>
     
<p> </p>
     
<hr width="100%">    
<h2> <a name="Administrative_functions"></a>Administrative functions</h2>
    These are the functions the infrastructure uses to manage call environments. 
 You will seldom need to use these functions directly.    
<p>GalSS_Environment *<a name="GalSS_EnvCreate"></a><b><big>GalSS_EnvCreate</big></b>(GalIO_CommStruct
  *<i>gcomm</i>) <br>
   Creates an environment from the connection <i>gcomm</i>. </p>
     
<p> </p>
     
<p>int&nbsp;<a name="GalSS_EnvReturnRequired"></a><b><big>GalSS_EnvReturnRequired</big></b>(GalSS_Environment
  *<i>env</i>) <br>
   Returns 1 if the call environment represents a dispatch function invocation 
 for which a return is expected, or 0 if it does not. </p>
